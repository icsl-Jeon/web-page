title: ROS Node as Adapter of Core Logic
date: 2023-04-27
description:
  When collaborating with others on a software project, it's important to ensure
  that the codebase is consistent and well-formatted. This can be achieved
  through the use of code formatting tools such as cmake-format and
  clang-format. cmake-format is a tool that helps to format CMake files in a
  consistent and readable manner. clang-format, on the other hand, is a tool
  that can be used to format C++, Java, JavaScript, and other code in a
  consistent style. By using these tools, developers can ensure that the
  codebase is consistent and easy to read, which can make it easier for other
  developers to understand and work with the code. This can be especially
  important when working on large projects with many contributors, where
  inconsistent formatting can lead to confusion and errors.

# ROS Node as Adapter of Core Logic

<Frontmatter />

Look at some of famous projects including ROS interface:
[octomap](https://github.com/OctoMap/octomap_ros),
[voxblox](https://github.com/ethz-asl/voxblox),
[cartographer](https://github.com/orgs/cartographer-project/repositories), and
[zed](https://github.com/stereolabs). Can you guess what is shared between them?
**They tried to separate their core logic from ROS either by separating the
repository or directories.** In this article, we will walkthrough why it is
important and how we can setup that kind of file structures and `CMakeList.txt`
for your project.

## ROS as adapter, not entangler

Before discussing separation, I want to introduce a perspective that **ROS can
be seen as an _adapter_**. Understanding this concept will help you clearcut ROS
from your core logic.

### Recap on adapter pattern

[Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter) is a very famous
design pattern, which can be understood with the following words: wrapper,
interface, bridge,or interpreter. Let us see the following three code snippets.

```cpp filename="AdapterForGameEditor.hpp" {1,2,7}
#include "my_core_logic.hpp"
#include "GameAsset.hpp"
class AdapterForGameEditor: public GameAsset { // GameAsset = interfacing with Game.cpp
  public:
    void run() override;
  ...
  private:
    CoreLogic core_logic_;
  ...
}
```

```cpp filename="AdapterForGameEditor.cpp"
#include "AdapterForGameEditor.hpp"

void AdapterForGameEditor::run() {
  core_logic_.run();
}
```

```cpp filename="Game.cpp"
#include "AdapterForGameEditor.hpp"
GameAsset* asset_with_core_logic = new AdapterForGameEditor();
asset_with_core_logic->run();
```

Here, `Game.cpp` can be seen as a client code, which knows only `GameAsset`
class. To perform some `my_core_logic` encapsulated inside `GameAsset`, we can
adopt the below adapter pattern for `GameAsset` by defining
`AdapterForGameEditor` which understands the interface `GameAsset` while
including core logic.

### ROS node can be also an adapter

In a very similar manner, we can easily
[find](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros2-wrapper/blob/master/zed_components/src/zed_camera/include/zed_camera_component.hpp)
the below _adapter-pattern_ code.

```cpp {1,2,10}
#include <rclcpp>
#include <sl/Camera.hpp> // core
class ZedCamera : public rclcpp::Node{ // Node = base class having ROS interfacing
  ...
  //
  image_transport::CameraPublisher mPubRgb; // some publishers
  clickedPtSub mClickedPtSub; // some subscriber

  ...
  sl::Camera mZed; // core class from
}
```

As you can see, some core header is included as a member of ROS node, while the
ros node has interface derived from `Node`. More generally, this kind of code
can be expressed with the below pseudo code (although I expressed in ROS2 code,
):

```cpp filename="YourRosNodeClass.hpp (adapter pattern)"
#include <rclcpp>
#include <your_core_logic.hpp>

class YourRosNode : public rclcpp::Node{
  ...
  // set of publishers
  rclcpp::Publisher<T>::SharedPtr publisher_;
  // set of subscribers
  rclcpp::Subscriber<T>::SharedPtr subscriber_;

  // core logic class
  YourCodeLogicClass core_class_;
}

```

As you can see from the above, your ROS node `YourRosNode` can be made from 1)
inheriting interface `Node` class and including core logic `YourCoreClass`.

## Organization

### ROS and core logic on same file? Only if you are 100% sure that ROS is the only outlet!

Let us assume that we have a core logic and it should be shipped to various
platforms. This is the case for [ZED](https://github.com/stereolabs) SDK which
should be delivered to [Unity](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-unity),
[Unreal](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-UE5),
[H-hub](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-hub-examples), and
[ROS 2](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros2-wrapper),... If you are in a
similar situation, it is insane if you entangle ROS code and pure logic which
should be reused across different outlets. Of course, ZED did not go that way.
See this picture:

    className="my-3"
  />

### So, what is the direction?

Simple: **YOUR CORE LOGIC SHOULD RUN AND TESTED WITHOUT ROS**. Your aim is to
make your logics reusable across many outlets. Calling a core package as `core`
and a ros wrapping package as `ros-wrapper`, this can be achieved by:

- Your `core` should be a _pure CMake package_ for easy reusability, not
  [catkin](https://wiki.ros.org/catkin) or
  [ament](https://design.ros2.org/articles/ament.html) package. You can create
  pure cmake package by `ros2 pkg create --build-type core` in ROS2.
- You have two different directories or repositories for storing 1) `core`
  and 2) `ros-wrapper`.
- `ros wrapper` only finds and uses `core` in `CMakeLists.txt`. Also,
  `ros wrapper` should not contain complex logics. It just sets incoming data
  for `core` and gets the computation result from `core`.
- For your development convenience, it would be good if `core` and `ros-wrapper`
  are built with a single build command (`colcon build` or `catkin_make`) on a
  workspace (e.g., `ros2_ws` or `catkin_ws`).
- Testing `core` should be possible without `ros-wrapper`.
