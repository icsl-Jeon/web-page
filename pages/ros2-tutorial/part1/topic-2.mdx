# Understanding Topic Communication - Part 2

Before getting started with this chapter, run `turtlesim_node` and
`turtle_teleop_key` as
[this page](key-concepts#running-ros-applications-executable).

## One-to-many communications

In contrast to [service communication](key-concepts#service-communication),
topic communication is one-to-many. Multiple subscribers can listen to a given
topic. Let us examine this by running another node:

```sh copy
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node --ros-args -r __node:=crazy_turtle
```

This will run `turtlesim_node` executable and name the node `crazy_turtle`, as
the command shows:

```sh filename="" {2}
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 node list
/crazy_turtle # our new node here
/teleop_turtle
/turtlesim
```

Our new node is also subscribing `/turtle1/cmd_vel`:

```sh filename="" {5}
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 node info /crazy_turtle
/crazy_turtle
  Subscribers:
    /parameter_events: rcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterEvent
    /turtle1/cmd_vel: geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
```

Using your keyboard on `/teleop_turtle` will move two turtles at the same times.

This example illustrates one-to-many communication property of topic communications.{" "}

## QoS: Policy for Communication (Advanced)

Previously, there was [a mention](key-concepts#topic-communication) that a
publisher can configure the _guarantee_ of message delivery. This configuration
belongs to Quality of Service (QoS). In ROS2, you can
[configure the policies](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings.html#qos-policies)
for communication. A Publisher and a subscriber can communicate only when they
have compatible policies.

### Example: Reliability

#### Case 1: Allowable Loss

As one of the policies, you can configure the _reliability_ of a communication.
For example, there might be a case where a loss can be allowable in sensor data
streaming. This can be true when only the most recent data matters. In this
case, `best effort` configuration is enough, and the publisher will not be
concerned whether the data is received successfully.

#### Case 2: Guaranteed Delivery

There might be a contrary case, where the publisher or subscriber should ensure
the delivery. An example can include subscribing to diagnosis, and not missing a
defect can be crucial in this case. `reliable` configuration can work here.
Here, the publisher uses feedback from ROS network and will retry to send a
message several times.

### Profile

As this page shows, there are many policies and associated options. ROS provides
several presets
([profiles](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings.html#qos-profiles))
for common cases. For example, the profile `Sensor Data` is recommended for the
first case.

### Practice

In our example, `/turtlesim` subscribes `/turtle1/cmd_vel` in `reliable`
configuration. To observe this, terminate `/teleop_turtle` for the moment, and
try the below command:

```sh filename="" {14}
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 topic info /turtle1/cmd_vel -v # Put verbose flag -v
Type: geometry_msgs/msg/Twist

Publisher count: 0

Subscription count: 1

Node name: turtlesim
Node namespace: /
Topic type: geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
Endpoint type: SUBSCRIPTION
GID: 01.0f.8d.3c.04.04.e9.37.01.00.00.00.00.00.1b.04.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00
QoS profile:
  Reliability: RELIABLE
  History (Depth): UNKNOWN
  Durability: VOLATILE
  Lifespan: Infinite
  Deadline: Infinite
  Liveliness: AUTOMATIC
  Liveliness lease duration: Infinite
```

As summarized in
[this table](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings.html#qos-compatibilities),
only reliable publishers can communicate with the subscription. To examine this,
the argument regarding QoS is added to the
[publish command](topic-1#publishing-topic).

```sh copy
ros2 topic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel -r 10 geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 1.0, y: 0, z: 0}, angular: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 1}}" --qos-profile=sensor_data --print 0 --qos-profile=sensor_data
```

You can observe that the communication is not established as the output says:

```sh
shpublisher: beginning loop
[WARN] [1691756541.068217364] [_ros2cli_1380]: New subscription discovered on topic '/turtle1/cmd_vel', requesting incompatible QoS. No messages will be sent to it. Last incompatible policy: RELIABILITY
```

## Summary

Over the two chapters, we learned the topic communication for streaming
messages. The below items were discussed:

- Interface (type) of topic communication.
- Publishing messages for a topic from a terminal or the GUI tool.
- Communication property of one-to-many
- QoS policy.

In the next chapter, we investigate service communication and understand the the
difference with topic communications.
