# Service communication

This chapter discusses service communication, which was briefly introduced in
[the preceding section](key-concepts#service-communication). In contrast to
topic communication which is conceptually data streaming to many subscribers,
Service communication is fulfilled only when a client (caller of a service)
receives the response from the server.

## Service Interface

Before proceeding, run `turtlesim_node` executable. üê¢

```sh copy
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

### Examine Registered Services

We can list the names of services by:

```sh filename="Names of registered service communications"
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 service list # get names of service communications
/clear
/kill
/reset
/spawn
/turtle1/set_pen
/turtle1/teleport_absolute
/turtle1/teleport_relative
/turtlesim/describe_parameters
/turtlesim/get_parameter_types
/turtlesim/get_parameters
/turtlesim/list_parameters
/turtlesim/set_parameters
/turtlesim/set_parameters_atomically
```

Note that the list consists of registrations from both servers and clients. For
example, if a node has a client who wants to call a service named
`/some_service`, the command `ros2 service list` includes `/some_service`.

```sh filename="Communication registrations of /turtlesim" {7, 21}
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 node info /turtlesim
/turtlesim
  Subscribers:
    ...
  Publishers:
    ...
  Service Servers: # registrations of service servers
    /clear: std_srvs/srv/Empty
    /kill: turtlesim/srv/Kill
    /reset: std_srvs/srv/Empty
    /spawn: turtlesim/srv/Spawn
    /turtle1/set_pen: turtlesim/srv/SetPen
    /turtle1/teleport_absolute: turtlesim/srv/TeleportAbsolute
    /turtle1/teleport_relative: turtlesim/srv/TeleportRelative
    /turtlesim/describe_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/DescribeParameters
    /turtlesim/get_parameter_types: rcl_interfaces/srv/GetParameterTypes
    /turtlesim/get_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/GetParameters
    /turtlesim/list_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/ListParameters
    /turtlesim/set_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/SetParameters
    /turtlesim/set_parameters_atomically: rcl_interfaces/srv/SetParametersAtomically
  Service Clients: # registrations of service clients (currently none)
```

In contrast to [topic names](topic-1#examining-messages-being-published),
service communications seem to be giving a command as their names indicate
(e.g., `/clear`, `/spawn` or `/turtle1/set_pen`).

### Service Types

As we learned [here](topic-1#message-types), topic communication can be
described by fields of message contents. For example,

```sh filename="Getting type of /spawn service"
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 service type /spawn # ros2 service type <service_name>
turtlesim/srv/Spawn # <package_name>/srv/<service_type_name>
```

`/spawn` is described by `turtlesim/srv/Spawn`, which equals to:

```sh filename="Getting service type" {6}
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 interface show turtlesim/srv/Spawn # ros2 interface show <service_type_name>
float32 x
float32 y
float32 theta
string name # Optional.  A unique name will be created and returned if this is empty
---
string name
```

In contrast to the topic interface, the service description is divided into two
sections: request and response.

### Calling a Service

As the above description shows, the request of `/spawn` was described by
`x,y,theta` and `name`. Before proceeding, confirm the below:

```sh filename="Topic list when only single turtle" {4-6}
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 topic list
/parameter_events
/rosout
/turtle1/cmd_vel
/turtle1/color_sensor
/turtle1/pose
```

Now, we call the `/spawn` service by:

```sh copy
ros2 service call /spawn turtlesim/srv/Spawn "{x: 3, y: 3, theta: 0, name: "turtle2"}"
```

This will output the below communication result:

```sh filename="Output of calling spawn service"
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 service call /spawn turtlesim/srv/Spawn "{x: 3, y: 3, theta: 0, name: "turtle2"}"
requester: making request: turtlesim.srv.Spawn_Request(x=3.0, y=3.0, theta=0.0, name='turtle2')

response:
turtlesim.srv.Spawn_Response(name='turtle2')
```

As [the description](#service-types), `response` outputs `name`. Now our turtle
`turtle1` has a friend `turtle2` as the figure shows:

<Image
  src="/images/part1/two-turtle.png"
  width={400}
  height={400}
  className="my-3 mx-auto"
/>

A few more topics were added also:

```sh filename="Topic list after turtle2 spawned" {7-10}
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 topic list
/parameter_events
/rosout
/turtle1/cmd_vel
/turtle1/color_sensor
/turtle1/pose
/turtle2/cmd_vel
/turtle2/color_sensor
/turtle2/pose
```

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  **A homework**. In [this section](topic-1#publishing-topic), we published
  topic `/turtle1/cmd_vel` to make the turtle circle around. Try on your own to
  move the second turtle we've spawned.
</Callout>

#### Using GUI Tool (`rqt_gui`)

In a similar way to [topic publishing in `rqt_gui`](topic-1#using-gui-tools), we
can call a service easily as the video demonstrates:

<div className="sm:px-5 my-10">
  <YouTube videoId="HLJC4WyxQsM" className="videoWrapper" />
</div>

### Service Request from Node

As a service caller (client) is a kind of communication object, a node can
request a service. To observe this, make sure you have two turtles. Run our new
executable `draw_square` by:

```sh filename="Run draw_square executable"

rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 run turtlesim draw_square
[INFO] [1692020201.521227190] [draw_square]: New goal [7.544445 5.544445, 0.000000]
[INFO] [1692020203.473165793] [draw_square]: Reached goal
[INFO] [1692020203.473228893] [draw_square]: New goal [7.448444 5.544445, 1.570796]
```

Up on the start of the associated node, the `turtle2` is removed and the turtle
tries to follow a square. Why the `turtle2` was removed?

```sh filename="List of communications of /draw_square" {18}
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 node info /draw_square
/draw_square
  Subscribers:
    /parameter_events: rcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterEvent
    /turtle1/pose: turtlesim/msg/Pose
  Publishers:
    /parameter_events: rcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterEvent
    /rosout: rcl_interfaces/msg/Log
    /turtle1/cmd_vel: geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
  Service Servers:
    /draw_square/describe_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/DescribeParameters
    /draw_square/get_parameter_types: rcl_interfaces/srv/GetParameterTypes
    /draw_square/get_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/GetParameters
    /draw_square/list_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/ListParameters
    /draw_square/set_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/SetParameters
    /draw_square/set_parameters_atomically: rcl_interfaces/srv/SetParametersAtomically
  Service Clients:
    /reset: std_srvs/srv/Empty
  Action Servers:

  Action Clients:
```

As shown in the above output, the node `/draw_square` had a service caller for
`/reset` which resets `/turtlesim` to the initial scene (having a single turtle
`turtle1`). In fact this service is called inside `/draw_square` when the node
[starts](https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/blob/ba29c3f376197e3736f497639299f855cbf73390/turtlesim/tutorials/draw_square.cpp#L164C1-L165C36).
Note that you do not need to understand the code.
