# Understanding Topic Communication - Part 1

In this section, we learn more about topic communication with tangible examples.
Before starting, run the previously used two ROS nodes following
[here](key-concepts#running-ros-applications-executable).

## Topic Interface

### Examining Messages Being Published

A publisher of a topic sends message stream in a defined way. For example, a
publisher of sensor data periodically sends out the messages. In our example,
`/turtlesim` keeps sending messages for `/turtle1/pose`. This can be checked by:

```sh filename="Printing out topic"
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 topic echo /turtle1/pose # ros topic echo <topic_name>
x: 5.544444561004639
y: 5.544444561004639
theta: 0.0
linear_velocity: 0.0
angular_velocity: 0.0
---
x: 5.544444561004639
y: 5.544444561004639
theta: 0.0
linear_velocity: 0.0
angular_velocity: 0.0
---
...
```

Try the below command to get periodicity:

```sh filename="Checking Hz"
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 topic hz /turtle1/pose # ros topic hz <topic_name>
average rate: 62.545 # being published at around 60Hz
       min: 0.015s max: 0.017s std dev: 0.00046s window: 64
average rate: 62.480
       min: 0.015s max: 0.017s std dev: 0.00045s window: 127
```

This periodical publishing is not always the case. The below command prints
nothing.

```
ros2 topic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel
```

If you press the upper-arrow key on the keyboard after focusing the terminal
where `/teleop_turtle` is running, now a print appears.

```sh filename="Terminal echo output"
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 topic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel
linear:
  x: 2.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
angular:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
---
```

The topic `/turtle1/cmd_vel` seems to be printed only when keyboard event is
received. You will note that the turtle in the GUI has moved. You may try
sending more messages with keyboard and observe the turtle's movement. üòä

### Message Types

In ROS 2, message structures are described using _interfaces_. The interfaces
are defined in packages. These interfaces are composed of multiple fields, where
each field's data type can be derived from primitive types like integers,
floats, strings, and
[more](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Concepts/About-ROS-Interfaces.html#field-types).
This allows developers to reuse or define the structure of the data being
communicated between nodes.

To get the type name of a topic, we first use the following command:

```sh
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 topic info /turtle1/pose # ros2 topic info <topic_name>
Type: turtlesim/msg/Pose
Publisher count: 1
Subscription count: 0
```

The message associated with `/turtle1/pose` has the interface
`turtlesim/msg/Pose`, which consists of the below field:

```sh
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 interface show turtlesim/msg/Pose  # ros2 interface show <type_name>
float32 x
float32 y
float32 theta

float32 linear_velocity
float32 angular_velocity
```

This is why printing `/turtle1/pose` gives us
[this output](#examining-messages). Type name `turtlesim/msg/Pose` implies that
package `turtlesim` holds the interface definition. This package has several
interfaces as this command shows:

```sh filename="list of interfaces of turtlesim"
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 interface package turtlesim # ros2 interface package <package_name>
turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute
turtlesim/msg/Color
turtlesim/srv/SetPen
turtlesim/srv/Spawn
turtlesim/srv/TeleportRelative
turtlesim/srv/TeleportAbsolute
turtlesim/srv/Kill
turtlesim/msg/Pose
```

## Publishing Topic

In the previous section, we observed that the turtle can be moved by your
keyboard input, as `/turtlesim` is subscribing topic `/turtle1/cmd_vel`
published from `/teleop_turtle`. This means the turtle will move even if another
node is publishing messages on the same topic ‚úåÔ∏è

Open another terminal and run the command:

```sh
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 topic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel -r 10 geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 1.0, y: 0, z: 0}, angular: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 1}}" --print 0
publisher: beginning loop
```

The command breaks down as:

- `ros2 topic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel`: publishing on the topic `/turtle1/cmd_vel`,
- `-r 10`: at rate 10 Hz,
- `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`: the interface is this type,
- `"{linear: {x: 1.0, y: 0, z: 0}, angular: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 1}}"`: and the
  message contents be like this.
- `--print 0`: do not fill the terminal.

This will move the turtle as below:

<Image
  src="/images/part1/turtle-circle.gif"
  width={300}
  height={300}
  className="my-3 mx-auto"
/>

### Using GUI tools

Although tab completion helps you, it might not be handy to type those commands
every time. In contrast to [CLI](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli) (commands in
terminal), [rqt_gui](https://wiki.ros.org/rqt_gui) provides graphical UIs.
Running the commands will open a qt window.

```sh copy
ros2 run rqt_gui rqt_gui
```

In the GUI, follow the below video.

<div className="sm:px-5 my-10">
  <YouTube videoId="v8NPUW_6aR4" className="videoWrapper" />
</div>
