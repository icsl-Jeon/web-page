On this page, we will look into two fundamental concepts of ROS: communication
types and nodes.

## Essentials

### Communication types

ROS employs two primary communication paradigms: _topic_ and _service_
communication. (the other type _action_ will not be covered here).

#### Topic communication

Imagine a scenario where a robot needs to disseminate information to multiple
recipients, similar to broadcasting on a TV network. In ROS, this is achieved
using the concept of a "topic.”

- Publisher (sender of message stream): transmits data on a specific topic. By
  default, it does not attempt to confirm whether the data is received by the
  intended recipients. But publishers can be configured to guarantee the
  reception. We will discuss this setup
  [later](topic-2#qos-policy-for-subscribers).
- Subscribers (receivers of message stream): register interest in a particular
  topic. Whenever data arrives on the network associated with a subscribed
  topic, a predefined _subscribe callback_ function is triggered, allowing the
  subscribers to process the data.

#### Service communication

Contrastingly, service-based communication in ROS follows a one-to-one
transaction model. This mechanism involves a pair of interactions: a request and
a corresponding response.

- Client (sender of request): serves as the initiator of requests.
- Server (sender of response): Upon receiving a request from the client, the
  server processes the provided information and carries out the requested task.
  Once the task is completed, the server constructs a response and send it back
  to the client, closing the transaction loop.

### Node

A node is a distinct unit within a ROS network that registers communication
objects, such as publishers, subscribers, clients, and servers. A node performs
the related tasks for the registered communications. It is instantiated
following the codes similar to the below snippet, and let us call the built
executables as _ROS application_.

````cpp
```cpp
#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
    auto node = rclcpp::Node::make_shared("name_of_your_node");

		// Communication registrations
		auto publisher = node->create_publihser(...)
		auto subsciber = node->create_publihser(...)
		...

    rclcpp::executors::SingleThreadedExecutor executor; // Executor handles operations for nodes
    executor.add_node(node); // Add your node to the executor. You can add multiples
    executor.spin(); // Start spinning the nodes (ROS communication starts)

    rclcpp::shutdown(); // Shutdown ROS when done
    return 0;
}
````

While not precisely identical, each ROS application is constructed similarly.
Note that an executable can run multiple nodes.

## Practice

Now, we'll practice the basic concepts of ROS 2 using the
[Turtlesim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqOMRchvTTY) _package_. A ROS
package corresponds to a
[project in cmake](https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/blob/ba29c3f376197e3736f497639299f855cbf73390/turtlesim/CMakeLists.txt#L2)
and contains a set of executables and libraries. To check the runnable
executables of a package, you can use the following command:

```sh
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 pkg executables turtlesim # ros2 pkg executables <package_name>
turtlesim_draw_square # names of executables
turtlesim mimic
turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

In the case of the Turtlesim package, there are four executables. You can find
the binary files in `/opt/ros/humble/lib/turtlesim`. What the command
`ros2 pkg executables turtlesim` did was reading this directory and show the
contents.

### Running ROS applications (executable)

You can run specific executables within a package. For example, let's run two
executables: `turtlesim_node` and `turtlesim_teleop` by the following commands:

In a terminal (call it Terminal A)

```sh filename="Terminal A"
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node # ros2 run <package_name> <executable_name>
```

This will open a GUI as the below figure:

<Image
  src="/images/part1/turtleapp.png"
  width={300}
  height={300}
  className="my-3 mx-auto"
/>

On another terminal (Termainl B)

```sh filename="Terminal B"
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
Reading from keyboard
---------------------------
Use arrow keys to move the turtle.
Use G|B|V|C|D|E|R|T keys to rotate to absolute orientations. 'F' to cancel a rotation.
'Q' to quit.
```

Running a ROS executable can initiate a set of nodes. To see the running nodes,
use the following command:

```sh
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 node list
/teleop_turtle # list of <node_name> (Note: it is different with <executable_name>
/turtlesim
```

The two executables instantiated two nodes named `/teleop_turtle` and
`/turtlesim`.

<Callout type="warning">
  Names of nodes and executables are different. `turtlesim_node` was the name of
  the executable. `/turtlesim` is a name decided in the associated code of
  `turtlesim_node`. The name can also be decided when running the executable.
  For example, `ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node --ros-args -r
  __node:=crazy_turtle` will run another node with name `/crazy_turtle`.
</Callout>

### Examining Nodes

A node can have multiple communication registrations. To get information about
the communication objects associated with a node, you can use the following
commands:

```bash filename="node info output"
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 node info /turtlesim # ros2 node info <node_name>
/turtlesim
  Subscribers:
    /parameter_events: rcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterEvent
    /turtle1/cmd_vel: geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
  Publishers:
    /parameter_events: rcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterEvent
    /rosout: rcl_interfaces/msg/Log
    /turtle1/color_sensor: turtlesim/msg/Color
    /turtle1/pose: turtlesim/msg/Pose
  Service Servers:
    /clear: std_srvs/srv/Empty
    /kill: turtlesim/srv/Kill
    /reset: std_srvs/srv/Empty
    /spawn: turtlesim/srv/Spawn
    /turtle1/set_pen: turtlesim/srv/SetPen
    /turtle1/teleport_absolute: turtlesim/srv/TeleportAbsolute
    /turtle1/teleport_relative: turtlesim/srv/TeleportRelative
    /turtlesim/describe_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/DescribeParameters
    /turtlesim/get_parameter_types: rcl_interfaces/srv/GetParameterTypes
    /turtlesim/get_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/GetParameters
    /turtlesim/list_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/ListParameters
    /turtlesim/set_parameters: rcl_interfaces/srv/SetParameters
    /turtlesim/set_parameters_atomically: rcl_interfaces/srv/SetParametersAtomically
  Service Clients:

  Action Servers: # For the moment,
    /turtle1/rotate_absolute: turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute
  Action Clients:
```

As we have learned, a node contains publishers, subscriber, server, client. Each
line consists of the name of the target communications and
[interface type](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Concepts/About-ROS-Interfaces.html?highlight=interface).
(for the interface, we will discuss from the following sections.) Try yourself
for node `/teleop_turtle` to list up the communications.

To visually understand the communication between nodes, you can use the
`rqt_graph` tool. This tool generates a graphical representation of the
communication graph:

```
ros2 run rqt_graph rqt_graph
```

This will open a window displaying the communication connections between nodes.

<Image
  src="/images/part1/rqt.png"
  width={600}
  height={300}
  className="my-3 mx-auto"
/>

You can see that topic `/turtle1/cmd_vel` is shared, meaning that messages sent
from `/teleop_turtle` will be delivered to the node `/turtlesim`. (Please ignore
arrows having `*/_action/*`.)

## Summary

Congratulation🎶! You fast learned very essential concepts and run ROS
applications by your hands. In the following section, we discuss more details on
each communication type and its characteristics.
