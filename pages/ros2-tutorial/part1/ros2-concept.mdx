# Understanding ROS: Framework and Ecosystem for Robotic Applications

First of all, ROS, short for Robot Operating System, is not an operating system
(OS) like Linux or Mac. The simple and correct way to understand ROS is:

1. an easy-to-use wrapper for communications
2. an ecosystem

which are specifically designed for robotics applications.

## 1. Easy-to-use Wrapper for Communications

Regardless of ROS development, there existed a well-established communication
protocol known as [DDS](https://design.ros2.org/articles/ros_on_dds.html). ROS2
serves as a C++/Python wrapper for this middleware, offering a straightforward
implementation for robotic applications.

### Communications provided by ROS

The communications available include the below:

- **Topic publish-subscribe:** The publish-subscribe mechanism enables different
  nodes (components) in the system to communicate by sending and receiving
  messages through topics. It facilitates seamless data exchange between various
  parts of the robot or across multiple robots.

- **Service communication:** ROS allows nodes to offer services and request
  services from others, enabling remote procedure calls and synchronous
  communication patterns.

Although there is another type of communication called _action_, this will not
be covered here.

### Easy-to-use Wrapper

Using ROS allows you to perform the above communications in your programs, as in
the below example.

```cpp
#include <rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp>
#include <std_msgs/msg/string.hpp>

class MinimalPublisher : public rclcpp::Node
{
public:
  MinimalPublisher()
    : Node("minimal_publisher")
  {
    publisher_ = this->create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>("topic", 10);
    timer_ = this->create_wall_timer(
      std::chrono::milliseconds(500),
      std::bind(&MinimalPublisher::publish_message, this));
  }

private:
  void publish_message()
  {
    auto message = std_msgs::msg::String();
    message.data = "Hello, ROS2!";
    publisher_->publish(message);
  }

  rclcpp::Publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>::SharedPtr publisher_;
  rclcpp::TimerBase::SharedPtr timer_;
};

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  rclcpp::init(argc, argv);

  auto publisher = std::make_shared<MinimalPublisher>();

  rclcpp::spin(publisher);
  rclcpp::shutdown();
  return 0;
}

```

Once you provide end-user source codes, ROS will handle all subroutines for DDS
communications, including message transport, callback scheduling, and interface
generation for C++/Python.

    used sensors and robots do the same.

Either indirectly or directly, ROS offers a vast ecosystem of packages that
extend its capabilities, enabling developers to build sophisticated robotic
applications. Some key components of this ecosystem include:

### Project management

- **Package managing and workspace (colcon / ament_cmake):** ROS offers a build
  system with workspace functionality and user-friendly dependency management to
  facilitate the seamless management of multiple packages in an organized
  manner.

- **Common Protocol Types and easy generation of custom types (rosidl):** ROS
  provides a set of common message types, such as strings, integers, and
  custom-defined messages, which facilitate standardized data exchange.

### Utilities

- **Visualization (rviz):** The ROS Visualization (rviz) tool enables developers
  to visualize robot states, sensor data, and other important information in a
  3D environment, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

- **Record and Play (rosbag):** ROS provides tools for recording data during
  robot operation and playing it back for analysis and debugging, allowing
  developers to reproduce scenarios for testing purposes.

- **Coordinate Transform Management (tf):** ROS includes a coordinate transform
  management packages (tf) to handle complex coordinate transformations,
  critical in multi-sensor and multi-robot systems.

### Simulation & Hardware

- **Physics Simulation by Plugin (gazebo_ros):** ROS integrates with physics
  simulation environments through plugins, allowing developers to test robot
  behavior in realistic virtual environments.

- **Hardware Support and ROS Wrappers:** Many well-known hardware manufacturers
  offer ROS wrappers, allowing users to easily integrate and test their hardware
  with ROS. This compatibility promotes seamless hardware testing and
  development within the ROS framework.

### And More

The ROS ecosystem continues to grow, with numerous additional packages available
for various functionalities, such as perception, navigation, manipulation, and
human-robot interaction. You can visit [here](https://index.ros.org/) to look up
the available repository in the ecosystem.
