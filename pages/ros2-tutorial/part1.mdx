# Part 1: Getting Familiar with ROS2

This part will introduce you to the basics of ROS2, including:

- Correct and simple way to understand ROS2
- Types of provided communications and how to use them
- Utilities (rqt_gui, rqt_graph) and CLI commands
- Parameters and namespace

Throughout this part, the prebuilt executables of packages
[_turtlesim_](https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/tree/humble/turtlesim)
(denotes turtle-simulator) will be used, and we won't write a code. By running
the executables and interacting with our terminals, you will get used to
essential concepts of ROS.
