# Types of Motion Planners at a Glance

<Frontmatter />

## Objective

This short article is to provide you with a comprehensive glance into the five
big categories and general concepts of planning methods, accompanied by valuable
GitHub references. Some representative methods for each group are introduced and
pros & cons are discussed. We also examine their applications in robotic
scenarios.

## Type 1: Roadmap Construction and Planning

Roadmap construction is a commonly used technique to create a structured
representation and identify topology. Initially, this method was not solely
intended for path planning; however, we can use the structure to find a path
between two nodes.

Despite yielding a coarse output, the path planning process results in a
reliable geometric skeleton. This skeleton aids in efficiently navigating
through the environment while avoiding obstacles.

### Methods

There are two common approaches to build the roadmap: _visibility graph_ and
_voronoi diagram_.

  <div className="mx-auto">
    Left: Visibility graph and shortest path between points [1]. Right:
    Partition based on the points (black) and the resulting voronoi diagram [2].
  </div>
</div>

#### Visibility Graph

The visibility graph is created by connecting visibility lines between
significant points in the environment. These points may represent obstacles,
robot poses, or other critical locations.

#### Voronoi Diagram

The Voronoi diagram is a spatial partitioning method used to divide a given
space into regions based on the proximity to a set of input points, also known
as "seeds" or "sites." Each region corresponds to a seed, and all points within
that region are closer to that seed than to any other seed.

### Features

#### Strengths

- Generates a geometric path for navigating very narrow passages.
- Provides a good geometric topology, making it suitable as a search start point
  to find a global optimum.
- If the environment is not changing and multiple shortest path queries
  expected, this group is very useful.

#### Weaknesses

- In many cases, considering kinematics is almost impossible, which means there
  is no guarantee that your robot can exactly follow the path.
- For the visibility graph, it often requires a well-defined geometric
  representation of the environment (e.g., polygons), which might not be
  feasible in real-time sensing scenarios.

## Type 2: Search-based Planners

In algorithmic terms, "search" refers to the process of exploring neighbors in a
guided manner. We can employ algorithms such as Dijkstra or A\* algorithm to
search from a starting state until a goal is reached. The variations lie in how
we define the neighbors (e.g., kinematic expansion or neighbor cells in a grid)
or [heuristic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)>) to
guide the search process effectively.

You can find a well-implemented version of this class in the "nav2" [3] or
"SBPL" [4] repositories.

### Methods

  <div className="flex flex-col xl:flex-row">
    <Image
      src="/images/post20/state-lattice.png"
      width={400}
      height={400}
      className="m-2"
    />
    <Image
      src="/images/post20/theta.png"
      width={400}
      height={400}
      className="m-2"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="mx-auto mx-2">
    Left: We search over a possible propagation based on a kinematics [5].
    Right: theta* algorithm (similar to A*) used for gaming [6].
  </div>
</div>

#### Discrete Planning over Gridmap

One of the classic yet still widely used approaches for solving a sequence of
cells for the shortest geometric path. This method serves as an excellent
baseline for 2-dimensional path-finding in a grid-based environment. We can
apply A\* algorithm here, but more recent and advanced method includes Jump
Point Search (JPS) [21].

#### State Lattice Planning

Building upon the grid-searching approach mentioned earlier, we can extend it to
kinematic searching. Search space becomes the set of reachable states when the
robot is assumed to steer with a discrete set of inputs. The search process
remains similar to that of grid searching. One of the famous approaches is
Hybrid A\* [20]. You can find a good implementation from
[Nav2 Smac Planner](https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/packages/configuring-smac-planner.html).

### Feature

#### Strength

- Resolution completeness: The search solution is optimal within the given
  discretization.

#### Weakness

- Search time is not scalable for high dimensions.
- In very dense scenarios, the use of only predefined discretization may lead to
  an inability to find a solution.

## Type 3: Sampling-based Planners

Sampling-based motion planning algorithms use random sampling to explore the
search space and build a tree or roadmap connecting feasible states. These
algorithms start with an initial configuration and iteratively sample new
states, connecting them to the tree if they satisfy certain criteria.

The variations may lie in whether optimality is included (e.g., RRT [12] →
RRT\*[7]), how to bias sampling in an informed way [9]. The extensive
implementation of these algorithms from OMPL [8]. For the python version, this
repository [10] might be useful.

### Methods

<div className="flex flex-col align-center max-w-full p-3">
  <div className="flex flex-col xl:flex-row">
    <Image
      src="/images/post20/rrt.gif"
      width={400}
      height={300}
      className="m-2"
    />
    <Image
      src="/images/post20/prm.gif"
      width={400}
      height={400}
      className="m-2"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="mx-auto mx-2">
    Left: Animation of RRT tree growing [10]. Right: RPM randomly generates
    roadmap [11].
  </div>
</div>

#### RRT (Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree)

The main objective of RRT is to efficiently explore the search space to find
feasible paths from the start state to the goal state. RRT is particularly
well-suited for problems with high-dimensional configuration spaces and complex
obstacle environments. While RRT does not guarantee an optimal solution, it can
quickly discover feasible paths and is often used in real-time applications.

#### PRM (Probabilistic Roadmap)

The primary objective of PRM is to construct a roadmap for a search space by
sampling random configurations and connecting them to build a network of
feasible states and connections. The roadmap serves as a global representation
of the environment, and once constructed, it can be used for efficient
query-based planning to find optimal paths between any start and goal
configuration.

### Feature

#### Strength

- Comparison with search-based planning in terms of high dimensionality:
  Sampling-based PRM algorithms, including PRM*, RRT*, and RRT\*, demonstrate
  significant advantages in solving high-dimensional motion planning problems.

#### Weakness

- Realtimeness might not be guaranteed for the optimality version
- Unpredictability is expected compared to search-based planners due to the
  random sampling.

## Type 4: Optimization-based Method

The preceding three groups employ algorithmic approaches to solve path-finding
in a discrete domain. In contrast, optimization-based methods leverage the
gradient descent technique to tackle numerical optimization problems. These
methods operate in the continuous domain, providing a more rigorous reflection
of dynamics.

### Methods

  <div className="flex flex-col xl:flex-row">
    <Image

      className="m-2"
    />
    <Image
      src="/images/post20/spline.png"
      width={300}

  </div>
  <div className="mx-auto mx-2">
    Left: Dubins and reed shepp trajectory is derived by solving optimal control
    problem [16]. Right: Seven piecewise polynomials are representing a flight
    curve of a quadrotor [15].
  </div>
</div>

#### Optimization over Control (a.k.a., Optimal Control)

Optimal control involves optimizing the trajectory of _control inputs_ (e.g., a
sequence of 100 linear and angular velocities for differential drive systems) to
minimize a given cost function based on the state. This method is often used
when we have to rigorously consider the dynamics of a system. When dealing with
relatively simple systems, the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) [13] is a common
method in this category. For solving such optimization problems, cvxgen [14] is
widely used and popular.

#### Optimization over State

In contrast to the optimal control, we might just want to optimize the
trajectory of _states_. Optimizers such as
[CHOMP](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/how_to_guides/chomp_planner/chomp_planner_tutorial.html?highlight=chomp),
[STOMP](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/how_to_guides/stomp_planner/stomp_planner.html?highlight=stomp)
are widely used, and implemented in Moveit. The below figure shows the proposed
optimization planner in [22]. The planner uses gradients from the obstacle cost
to compute a safe trajectory.

  height={500}
  className="m-2 mx-auto"
/>

#### Spline-based Method

The above-mentioned methods typically use state variables at each time step as
optimization variables, which may not be scalable for long-range planning. To
address this, we parameterize the trajectory of states or inputs using
polynomials, reducing the optimization dimension by optimizing the coefficients
of piecewise polynomials. This approach is widely utilized for generating
trajectory planning of quadrotors [15]. You can find the implementation of this
method here [16].

### Feature

#### Strength

- Kinematics and dynamics can be considered in the optimization process.
- Continuous space can be employed to compute optimal trajectories.

#### Weakness

- Convergence may be limited to local minima, particularly when the initial
  guess is far from the global optimum.
- In environments with dense and complex obstacles, convergence of the
  optimization process may degrade.
- The effectiveness of the method depends on the shape of the cost and
  constraint functions.

## Type 5: Motion Primitive Library

Among the introduced groups, the considered horizon is the shortest. This method
involves predefining possible movements over a short horizon and selecting the
best motion online. The candidates also should be checked for feasibility (e.g.,
collision). It is particularly useful in scenarios where there is a reliable
topological reference (e.g., autonomous driving on structured roads). You can
find an implmentation from here [19]

### Methods

<div className="flex flex-col align-center max-w-full p-3">
  <div className="flex flex-col xl:flex-row">
    <Image
      src="/images/post20/primitive-1.png"
      width={400}
      height={400}
      className="m-2"
    />
    <Image
      src="/images/post20/primitive-2.png"
      width={400}
      height={400}
      className="m-2"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="mx-auto mx-2">
    The final motion over a short horizon is chosen from a set of motion
    primitive (library) that best suites the purposes [17], [18]
  </div>
</div>

Before commencing the mission, a library predefines a set of dynamically
feasible motion primitives (e.g., polynomials). When the robot is at a specific
pose, the motions are transformed, and their feasibility is evaluated for
safety. After computing motion scores for trajectories, the final motion is
selected.

### Feature

#### Strength

- Easy to implement.
- The motion choices remain within the library, and thus intuitive.
- Does not require gradient computation for the cost and constraints.

#### Weakness

- For relatively longer horizons, the selected motion candidates might be unable
  to reach the desired destination.
- As the set of motions is predefined, the method cannot adapt to new motions
  that are not present in the library.

## What’s next?

Up to this point, we have explored five categories of motion planning and their
respective characteristics. However, navigating through complex environments
often requires sophisticated combinations of these methods. In the following
article, we delve into the combinations found in the most recent research papers
and well-known packages.
