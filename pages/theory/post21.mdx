# Hierarchial Framework: Combination of Planners

<Frontmatter />

In [the previous article](post20), the five types of planners were explained. In
practice, it is very rare to use a single planner type for complex environments.
This page introduces several examples of their combinations in recent papers.
Most of the combinations consist of global planning and local planning.

## 1. Roadmap as Topological Guide

Although paths on a roadmap are too coarse and jerk to be directly tracked with
a controller, they are good measures of possible topology until a goal. Based on
this, multiple combinations are found in the search.

### Roadmap + Sampling planner

Sampling-based planners might have difficulty with passing a narrow passage. The
proposed planning in [1] builds a structured roadmap first and sampling only
along a guide path, drastically reducing computation time at the cost of global
optimality.

### Roadmap + Search planner

Instead of relying on search based planner (Hybrid A\*) to solve a path until a
global goal, [2] reduces search complexity by solving multiple times to pursuit
the intermediate goal obtained from the visibility graph. Similar to the
previous combination, this can impair global optimality, as strictly passing
through waypoints can be inefficient in a global sense.

### Roadmap + Optimization

As pointed out [here](post20#weakness-2), the optimization planners are very
sensitive to an initial guess. The gradient-based method will converge to local
minimum around the initial guess. In many cases, the set of local minima can be
associated with the set of different topologies until the goal, where the
topological family can be estimated from a roadmap. Observing this intuition,
[3] (car) and [4] (drone) solves multiple nonlinear optimizations for possible
roads until the goal, and the best is selected as a good approximate of the
global optimal. Refer the below figure [3].

## 2. Sampling Planners as Shortest Distance Guide

Relying on sampling based planners such as RRT\* for high dimension systems can
be inefficient as steering between two states might not be computed fast enough
if we consider dynamics. The authors of [5] dealt with quadrotor system which is
originally high-dimension problem. Instead of solving the entire problem in a
single RRT* with kinematic steering, they proposed two steps: simple RRT* with
the straight line steering + quadratic programming on polynomial coefficients.

In this figure, (a) depicts the result when RRT\* is used with polynomial
steering. That is, the entire path was computed using only RRT\*. (b) -> (c) is
the pipeline proposed, where a RRT\* is first solved for the simplest steering
and polynomial post-processing finalizes the trajectory. According to the paper
[5], the former approach took more than 50 times than the latter.

## 3. Search Planners as Geometric Guide

Maybe this family is the most common combination, where search based planners
gives a frontend geometric output and the optimization computes a feasible
trajectory (time parameterized, dynamics considered).

### Search Planners (Constraint) + Quadratic Programming

The paper [6] uses a simple A\* algorithm to obtain a grid path toward goal.
Then, a safe corridor (sequence of boxes) is computed by expanding boxes along
the grid path. The next step is to generate a feasible trajectory confined to
the boxes.

In general, a quadrotor can follow a polynomial trajectory if its high-order
derivatives are small (jerk or snap minimization,
[source code](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/traj_gen)). If we represent the
flight path with the polynomial, constraint of safe boxes and minimizing high
order derivatives can be formulated into the quadratic programming w.r.t
polynomial coefficients, which is known to be stably converged to the global
optimal.

### Search Planners (Objective) + Quadratic Programming

In addition to a safe region, search-based planners can provide a sequence of
guiding points. The topic of my paper [7] was chasing a moving target with
optimal visibility.

When some of the motion objectives are complex and their evaluation is
expensive, we can first reflect them in high-quality waypoints and the remainder
of objectives is further considered in the following numerical optimization.

In my paper, it was expensive to compute a good vantage point for observing two
targets, as multiple factors should be considered simultaneously (see the left
part of the figure). I used the Dijkstra algorithm to pick a good point for each
discrete time step and then optimize polynomial trajectory to pursue the points
while remaining in a corridor.

### Search Planners (Initial Guess) + Nonlinear Optimization

When solving complex motion for non-holonomic systems such as cars, one of the
most common approaches is to mix hybrid A\* (frontend) and nonlinear
optimization for optimal control. The frontend determines motion phases such as
when to move backward or forward. Then the discrete phases are tracked by
dynamically feasible optimization. As an application, parking among complex
obstacles can be solved by this approach as [9] and [10].

The original paper of Hybrid A* [11] post-processed the output of hybrid A* for
further smoothing. As the path of Hybrid A\* consists of discrete choices of
steering, it can look jerky. Authors of [11] adopted the conjugate gradient
method for smoothing and safety (see below figure).

## 4. Motion Primitive Library as Final Follower

To use the [fifth type](post20#type-5-motion-primitive-library) planner, a local
goal over a short horizon is required, rather than using the global goal
directly. As the below video shows, the primitive library planner was used to
track the path from a global planner.
