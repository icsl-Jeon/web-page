**1. Representation:**

- ESDF: ESDF represents the environment as a grid-like structure, where each
  cell in the grid contains information about the distance to the nearest
  obstacle or surface. It provides an explicit representation of the space,
  meaning that each cell stores a specific distance value.
- TSDF: TSDF represents the environment using a volumetric data structure. It
  stores the signed distance to the nearest surface for each voxel in a 3D grid.
  Unlike ESDF, TSDF uses a continuous representation, meaning that the distance
  values are interpolated within the voxels.

**2. Distance Calculation:**

- ESDF: In ESDF, the distance to the nearest obstacle or surface is calculated
  explicitly and stored in each grid cell. This calculation is usually done
  using algorithms like the Fast Marching Method or Dijkstra's algorithm.
- TSDF: TSDF calculates the signed distance to the nearest surface based on the
  intersection of a 3D ray with the scene geometry. It typically involves
  raycasting techniques, such as ray-marching or ray-tracing, to calculate the
  distance values for the voxels.

**3. Spatial Resolution:**

- ESDF: ESDF has a fixed spatial resolution determined by the grid size. The
  resolution determines the level of detail and accuracy of the representation.
  Higher resolutions require more memory and computational resources.
- TSDF: TSDF also has a spatial resolution determined by the voxel size.
  However, since it uses a continuous representation, the resolution can be
  adjusted dynamically by choosing a smaller or larger voxel size. This
  flexibility allows for adaptive representations with varying levels of detail.

**4. Memory Efficiency:**

- ESDF: ESDF requires memory to store the explicit distance values for each grid
  cell. The memory consumption increases with higher resolutions.
- TSDF: TSDF typically requires less memory compared to ESDF because it stores
  signed distance values for voxels rather than explicit distances for every
  grid cell. Additionally, TSDF can be more memory-efficient if a truncated
  range is used, discarding information about distant surfaces.

Both ESDF and TSDF have their strengths and are used in different applications.
ESDF is commonly used in path planning, obstacle avoidance, and navigation
tasks, while TSDF is popular in 3D reconstruction, mapping, and augmented
reality applications. The choice between the two depends on the specific
requirements of the task at hand.
