# Frontend code for robotic system with state management - Part 1

<Frontmatter />

When designing a robotic system, the significance of state and its transition is
often overlooked in comparison to backend processes such as algorithms or
methods.

State management plays a crucial role in governing the system's operations.
Insufficient attention to clean code structure in state management can lead to
significant difficulties, considering the consistent modifications to states and
their transitions during the development process.

In the upcoming articles, I will guide you on writing frontend code that is both
manageable and adaptable.

## 1. Two types of events on a robotic system

Let's say you are developing a frontend code to operate an autonomous drone for
cinematography (for example, something like [this](https://www.skydio.com/)).

When building the system, you have to handle two types of events.

### Command events: coming from interaction with users

This system will interact with users with the following orders:

1. Initially, the drone will be on the ground (landed).
2. Then, it will hover when the user signals hovering by pressing button.
3. When the drone is flying at a defined height, users can designate the target
   for shooting (by dragging a bounding box on the screen).
4. If the user presses mission-start-button, it will try to follow the defined
   target.

First, your frontend code needs to handle these user commands, and reflect them
into drones' motion. For instance, if a user requested hovering, then the motion
generation should produce an elegant upward motion.

In the articles, I will refer to this type as **command event**.

### Monitor events: to be handled by robots autonomously

But, what if the drone loses a target during the flight? Should the drone notify
about the failure and wait for human instructions? Or, what if battery level is
low?

For enhanced autonomy of the system, the drone should be capable of handling
these events on its own. To this end, the autonomous robot should always
**monitor** whether they are doing well, and deal with issues (events) with
**defined logics**.

For example, in response to _TargetLost_ event, the drone should scan the
surroundings to search the target. Similarly, in reaction to _BatteryLow_ event,
drone should choose to land even without users' command.

Through articles, I will refer to this type of events as **monitor event**.

### We need a good code design for frontend

<div className="flex flex-col items-center">

    width={1000}
    height={500}
    className="my-3"
  />
  <p>**Fig.** Diagram of the drone system</p>
</div>
In sum, it seems that we have to implement the above diagram. What we have to worry
is that: **there must be a bunch of cases we should consider in the future!** We
have to write a manageable code to reuse our frontend code along the development.

## 2. Pipeline of robotic systems (frontend / backend)

For ease of further discussion, I first introduce a _model_ to describe a
general robot software stacks including frontend and backend. This model focuses
on state management and omits other functionalities such as
[threading](/threading-ros2) or [adaptors](/design-pattern/post5). This is the
model that I designed from my experience. So, it might have some limitations.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center m-5">
  <Image
    src="/images/post14/pipeline.png"
    width={1000}
    height={500}
    className="my-3"
  />
  <p>**Fig.** Frontend and backend of robotic system </p>
</div>

Let us read the diagram step by step, starting from backend (bottom).

### (1) Backend

In backend side, there exist core logics to be queried. [OMPL](tools/post13) is
a good example. They reside in the backend of
[moveit](https://moveit.ros.org/documentation/planners/) stacks. In general,
backend classes are member variables of their consumers (=frontend), and the
core logics are queried as
[this code](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/69ca441bc343c51544b19dde9c5a095481a3d906/moveit_ros/planning/planning_pipeline/src/planning_pipeline.cpp#LL257C36-L257C36)
illustrates.

In the above figure, backend corresponds to the `Core logics` block. From
frontend, they are requested some to compute a motion plan, from which actuation
inputs can be generated.

Often times, from interface of backends, we can find a strategy pattern or
switch phrases for the logics to be chosen depending on situation (= policy,
state).

### (2) Frontend

As a consumer of the backend logics, the frontend source code is responsible for
handle the various events from the world. For a robot, the world could mean
users. But, as we examined, the other party is a set of issues by sensing the
environment.

Based on this concept, I defined the scope of frontend as the above picture
depicts.

#### Command event

When users give a command (request) by either UI or urls, frontend code should
be able to parse the inputs and interpret the request so that backend code can
handle it. This is what `Interpret user command` represents.

#### Monitor event

In robotic system, we usually update sensor information (e.g., robot position,
battery level) from callback functions. In another thread, a timer callback
(periodic update loop) should run where the frontend should detects some
critical events (for example, low battery level). `Detect & issue events` block
takes this.

#### Event handlers and state transition

Next, the event should invoke transition state, so that the robot have a right
policy for events. **I will define state as some entity including motion
policy**, from which we can request a associated backend logics to generate a
motion of the robot (eventually to actuation inputs). For example, when we got
low-battery-event, the motion policy should be modified to a reduced version of
movement.

## 3. Wrapping up and what's next

Until so far, I introduced the concept of events (command event and monitor
event) along with the necessity of a clean code pattern for state management. As
I elaborated generic pipeline, I can now state that the below:

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

> In robotic system, state is some entity including motion policies. also,
> action can be thought as command events and monitor events.

With this concept, in part 2, I will examine the pattern shared widely by
frontend web developers, who might have deliberated a good design for the
history of the internet era.
