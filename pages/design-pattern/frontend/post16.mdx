# Frontend code for robotic system with state management - Part 3

<Frontmatter />

In the [previous article](post15), I discussed existing libraries for flow
management. In this article, I will suggest one way to implement a frontend code
by partially borrowing some concepts from Redux. You can find the complete code
[here](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/simple-robotics-pipeline).

## 1. Toy scenario

First, let's examine the flows that need to be managed in order to implement
[the scenario](post14). Please note that the flow discussed here is a simple
example of implementation.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center">
  <Image

    width={1000}
    height={500}
    className="my-3"
  />
  <p>**Fig.** Target flow diagram of autonomous drone cinematographer</p>
</div>

I will skip the explanation of each flow (arrows) until
[transition table](/design-pattern/frontend/post16#transition-table). For the
moment, please only note that even a simple system can have seemingly convoluted
flow diagram.

### Possible motion phases of drone

As the above picture overlays, we have six motion phases:

- **Idle**: This phase represents when nothing is being done, typically when the
  drone is first booted.
- **Hovering**: In this phase, when the user requests hovering, the drone tries
  to reach a defined height. We assume that this phase requires feedback
  information of the drone's position when calculating a control input. It works
  similar to a [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller).
- **Chasing**: When the user requests the start of shooting, the drone tries to
  (re)plan a flight path for a short horizon. If the plan expires, it needs to
  replan its chasing flight. This phase works similar to
  [Model predictive control (MPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control).
- **Exploration**: when the target is no longer visible to the drone during the
  chasing phase, it will attempt to explore the area near the last known
  location.
- **Holding**: Any of the above phases will transition into this phase when the
  safety of the drone is not guaranteed. When the drone's position becomes safe,
  it will revert to its previous phase. Therefore, we need to remember the
  previous phase.
- **Landing**: Landing can be triggered either by a user request or in a
  low-battery situation. It should be able to override all other phases as it is
  the most important behavior.

For each phase, various requirements are collected.

### Requirements to implement the phases

Based on the phases mentioned above, our frontend code should fulfill the
following requirements:

- Provide feedback of robot information for the PID controller (idle).
- Perform periodic replanning for the MPC (chasing).
- Maintain memory of motion phases (holding).
- Handle priority for more important states (landing and holding).

In this article, let's delves into how to write a awesome frontend code for
[robotic pipeline](post14#2-pipeline-of-robotic-systems-frontend--backend) while
inheriting the advantages of redux and achieving the requirements ðŸ˜Š

### File structure

As can be found in
[repo](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/simple-robotics-pipeline), the file
structure of suggested pipeline looks like:

```sh {10,16}
include/
â””â”€â”€ my_robotics_library
    â”œâ”€â”€ backend
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ obstacle_manager.h
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ planners
    â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ chasing_planner.h
    â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ height_planner.h
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ types.h
    â””â”€â”€ frontend
        â””â”€â”€ wrapper.h
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ chasing_planner.cc
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ height_planner.cc
â””â”€â”€ frontend
    â””â”€â”€ wrapper.cc

```

Here, `Wrapper` class located in `frontend` implements the frontend code. Now,
let us have a look how each component is written in a real code, step by step.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center">

    className="my-3"
  />
  <p>**Fig.** Frontend structure and we will look into five steps ðŸ˜‚</p>
</div>

## 2. Monitor to event definition

### Step 1: Sensor information

I defined
[the below](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/simple-robotics-pipeline/blob/7a6a2bc98865ec75dd03ed4bc3e30038fb283384/include/my_robotics_library/frontend/wrapper.h#L40)
as the sensor information (also can be used as a feedback).

```cpp
struct SensorInformation {
  TimedVelocity velocity;
  TimedPosition position;
  std::optional<TimedPosition> target_position;
  int battery_level{1};
};
...
```

In `Wrapper`, the sensor information will be set from
[_setters_](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/simple-robotics-pipeline/blob/7a6a2bc98865ec75dd03ed4bc3e30038fb283384/include/my_robotics_library/frontend/wrapper.h#L57-L60).
The setters will be used in consumers of `Wrapper` (for example, ros wrapper.
See [adaptor pattern](/design-pattern/post5)).

```cpp

class Wrapper {
public:
  Wrapper();

  void SetVelocity(const TimedVelocity &velocity);
  void SetPosition(const TimedPosition &position);
  void SetTargetPosition(const std::optional<TimedPosition> &target_position);
  void SetBatteryLevel(int level);

  ...

private:
  ...
  SensorInformation sensor_information_;
  ...
```

### Step 2: Monitor and state

#### State

In backend side, I defined the six motion phases:

```cpp filename="/include/my_robotics_library/backend/types.h"
enum MotionPhase {
  kLanding,
  kHolding,
  kExploration,
  kChasing,
  kHovering,
  kIdle
};
```

These motion phases are associated with how the robot system computes its
actuation, and they are used to decide which event should be detected (see the
next section, step 3). The state information
[is stored historically](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/simple-robotics-pipeline/blob/7a6a2bc98865ec75dd03ed4bc3e30038fb283384/include/my_robotics_library/frontend/wrapper.h#L72)
in `Wrapper`.

#### Monitor

In an update loop, we keep updating diagnosis using 1) latest
[`sensor_information_`](/design-pattern/frontend/post16#step-1-sensor-information)
and 2) current [state (its history)](/design-pattern/frontend/post16#state).

```cpp
struct Monitor {
  bool is_planning_visible{false};
  bool is_safe_for_short_horizon{true};
  bool is_battery_enough{true};
};
```

```cpp
void Wrapper::UpdateMonitor() {
  auto current_motion_phase = state_history_.back().motion_phase;

  if ((current_motion_phase != MotionPhase::kChasing &&
       current_motion_phase != MotionPhase::kExploration) ||
      !sensor_information_.target_position.has_value())
    monitor_.is_planning_visible = false;
  else
    monitor_.is_planning_visible = true;

  if (state_history_.back().motion_phase == MotionPhase::kHolding)
    monitor_.is_safe_for_short_horizon = true;
  else if (std::abs(sensor_information_.position.x) > 1)
    monitor_.is_safe_for_short_horizon = false;

  monitor_.is_battery_enough = sensor_information_.battery_level > 0;
}

```

#### What is the difference between state and monitor?

- _State_ is the result of transition from changes of _monitor_.
- _State_ should contain the only information needed to compute _motion_.

### Step 3: Read monitor event

To achieve the flow for
[our scenario](/design-pattern/frontend/post16#1-toy-scenario), I define the six
events:

```cpp
enum MonitorEvent { kHover, kLand, kHoldStop, kExplore, kChaseReplan, kNone };
```

Each event can transition a state to another following the below table:

|                               | kLanding | kHolding  | kExploration | kChasing     | kHovering |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------- |
| kLanding                      | x        | x         | x            | x            | x         |
| kHolding (memory of previous) | kLand    | x         | kExplore     | kChaseReplan | kHovering |
| kExploration                  | kLand    | kHoldStop | x            | kChaseReplan | x         |
| kChasing                      | kLand    | kHoldStop | kExplore     | kChaseReplan | x         |
| kHovering                     | kLand    | kHoldStop | x            | x            | x         |

These events are issued in the below function `ReadMonitorEvent`:

```cpp showLineNumbers
MonitorEvent Wrapper::ReadMonitorEvent() const {
  if (!monitor_.is_battery_enough &&
      state_history_.back().motion_phase != MotionPhase::kLanding)
    return MonitorEvent::kLand;

  if (!monitor_.is_safe_for_short_horizon)
    return MonitorEvent::kHoldStop;

  switch (state_history_.back().motion_phase) {
  case MotionPhase::kChasing: {
    if (!monitor_.is_planning_visible)
      return kExplore;

    using namespace std::chrono;
    auto elapse_since_planning =
        duration<double>(system_clock::now().time_since_epoch()).count() -
        motion_planning_result_->GetRequestTime();
    if (elapse_since_planning > 0.2)
      return MonitorEvent::kChaseReplan;
  }
  case MotionPhase::kExploration: {
    if (monitor_.is_planning_visible)
      return kChaseReplan;
  }
  case MotionPhase::kHolding: {
    auto previous_state = state_history_[state_history_.size() - 2];
    if (monitor_.is_safe_for_short_horizon) {
      switch (previous_state.motion_phase) {
      case MotionPhase::kExploration:
        return MonitorEvent::kExplore;
      case MotionPhase::kChasing:
        return MonitorEvent::kChaseReplan;
      case MotionPhase::kHovering:
        return MonitorEvent::kHover;
      case MotionPhase::kLanding:
        return MonitorEvent::kLand;
      }
    }
  }
  }
  return MonitorEvent::kNone;
}
```

Here are some noteworthy points:

- As L4 and L7 show, the events with higher priority take precedences by be
  positioned at the front. This can achieve the last itme of
  [requirements](post16#requirements-for-frontend-code) in a simple manner.

- From L11 to L20, checking expiration can issue **Replan** monitor event to
  renew the chasing flight in a MPC manner.

- From L26 to L36, the events issued from state **Holding** are for resuming the
  previous state before being held. This also satisfy the third item in
  [requirements](post16#requirements-for-frontend-code).

- The `ReadMonitorEvent` are computing only necessary MonitorEvent using current
  state. This could overcome the difficulty described
  [here](post15#difficulty-in-obtaining-the-active-state).

- Given state, issues event using monitor and other small operation

## 3. Transferring reducers (JS) to robotic frontend (C++)

In this chapter, we briefly discuss how I imported the code used in redux into
our c++ frontend code, resolving the language difference between Javascript and
c++.

### Reducer (JS) -> ProcessEvent (C++)

First of all, we discuss how I imported the
[structure of reducer](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/proshop_django/blob/master/frontend/src/reducers/orderReducers.js#L33-L60).
As this example shows, the Redux library allows us to define a reducer function
without explicitly specifying the types of actions (input argument). The content
of the action is referred to as the payload, which can be of any type.

```js filename="orderReducer.js" {12,18}
export const orderCreateReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ORDER_CREATE_REQUEST:
      return {
        loading: true,
      };

    case ORDER_CREATE_SUCCESS:
      return {
        loading: false,
        success: true,
        order: action.payload,
      };

    case ORDER_CREATE_FAIL:
      return {
        loading: false,
        error: action.payload,
      };

    case ORDER_CREATE_RESET:
      return {};

    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

In order to have a similar structure, I designed the below
[function](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/simple-robotics-pipeline/blob/7a6a2bc98865ec75dd03ed4bc3e30038fb283384/src/frontend/wrapper.cc#L129)
in c++:

```cpp filename="src/frontend/wrapper.cc"
State Wrapper::ProcessEvent(const State &state, const MonitorEvent &event) {
  State new_state = state;
  switch (event) {
  case kHover:
    new_state = HandleHovering(state);
    break;

  case kLand:
    new_state = HandleLanding(state);
    break;

  case kHoldStop:
    new_state = HandleHoldStop(state);
    break;

  case kExplore:
    new_state = HandleExploration(state);
    break;

  case kChaseReplan:
    new_state = HandleChasingPlan(state);
    break;
  }
  return new_state;
};

```

This structure is used to _reduce_ (state transition)
[`MonitorEvent`](post14#monitor-events-to-be-handled-by-robots-autonomously)
detected in a update loop, observing
[easy-to-understand](post15#simplicity-of-reducers-strength-of-boost-msm) state
transition design used in redux.

### Bottommost (JS) -> Uppermost (C++)

In redux, the transition logics (reducers) are normally defined in
[a separate file](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/proshop_django/tree/master/frontend/src/reducers),
at the bottommost to be included from others. Here, the transitions are defined
in the uppermost class `wrapper.cc` along with other functions. Although
seemingly entangling, it is more convenient approach as handlers can access the
all the information of the uppermost class `Wrapper`. Also, as will be discussed
below, each handler should update the member variable of `Wrapper`.

### Step 4: Handlers and updates of motion planning

Handlers are
[subroutine functions](/design-pattern/frontend/post16#reducer-js---processevent-c)
of `ProcessEvent`.
[Each five event](/design-pattern/frontend/post16#step-3-read-monitor-event) has
a corresponding handler. Handlers are responsible for 1) updating member
variables of `Wrapper`. and 2) state transition.

#### Update members of `Wrapper` and motion planning

class `Wrapper` has multiple
[motion planners](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/simple-robotics-pipeline/blob/7a6a2bc98865ec75dd03ed4bc3e30038fb283384/include/my_robotics_library/frontend/wrapper.h#L75-L76)
to interact with backend logics (motion planning, in this example).

```cpp filename="Wrapper"
class Wrapper {
...

private:
  backend::HeightPlanner height_planner_;
  backend::ChasingPlanner chasing_planner_;
...
```

The planners update `motion_planning_result_` which has the
[following definition](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/simple-robotics-pipeline/blob/7a6a2bc98865ec75dd03ed4bc3e30038fb283384/include/my_robotics_library/backend/types.h#L57):

```cpp
class MotionPlanningResult {

public:
  MotionPlanningResult(MotionPhase motion_phase, double t_request)
      : motion_type_(motion_phase), t_request_(t_request){};
  virtual Control GenerateControl(double t) const = 0;
  virtual std::vector<TimedPosition> GetPlanningTrajectory(double t0,
                                                           double tf) const = 0;
  MotionPhase GetMotionType() const { return motion_type_; };
  double GetRequestTime() const { return t_request_; }

private:
  MotionPhase motion_type_;
  double t_request_;
};
```

This result is computed from `ComputeXXXMotion(...)`:

```cpp {5}
class ChasingPlanner {
public:
  ChasingPlanner() = default;
  ChasingMotionPlanningResult
  ComputeChasingMotion(const ChasingPlannerInput &planner_input);
};

```

The below code shows how `kChaseReplan` event is handled inside `ProcessEvent`
and updates `motion*planning_result*``.

```cpp {6,9-11}
State Wrapper::HandleChasingPlan(const my_robotics_library::State &state) {
  if (!sensor_information_.target_position.has_value())
    return state;

  auto new_state = state;
  new_state.motion_phase = MotionPhase::kChasing; // change state
  backend::ChasingPlannerInput input;
  input.target_position = sensor_information_.target_position.value();
  auto chasing_plan = chasing_planner_.ComputeChasingMotion(input);
  motion_planning_result_.reset(
      new backend::ChasingMotionPlanningResult(chasing_plan)); // update motion generation
  return new_state;
}
```

### Step 5: Getting actuation from motion planning

The updated `motion_planning_result_` inside the handler can be used to query
the required control at a time `t`.

```cpp
Control ChasingMotionPlanningResult::GenerateControl(double t) const {
  Control control;
  control.phase = GetMotionType();
  control.t = t;
  control.input = planned_view_position_.x;
  return control;
}
```

In this function, we are getting the current control input from a planned entity
`planned_view_position_`. (this is just for a simple demonstration.)

#### Using feedback of `Wrapper` even after construction of MotionPlanningResult

What if we need latest `sensor_information_` during `GenerateControl(double t)`?
After all, in the above logic, the motion planning result was constructed only
when an event is read. For example, let us assume that hovering needs the
current position, which is working as a PID controller.

To ensure the feedback synchronization, a motion planner is provided with the
latest sensor information when setter of `Wrapper` is working:

```cpp {3}
void Wrapper::SetPosition(const my_robotics_library::TimedPosition &position) {
  sensor_information_.position = position;
  height_planner_.SetRobotPosition(position);
}
```

Then, a planner can
[pass the pointer](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/simple-robotics-pipeline/blob/7a6a2bc98865ec75dd03ed4bc3e30038fb283384/include/my_robotics_library/backend/planners/height_planner.h#L35)
to sensing information when computing the result. Thus, our motion generator can
use the feedback of its parent class, achieving the
[first requirement](post16#requirements-for-frontend-code).

## Summary

Along with previous articles, I introduced a starter frontend code for your
robotic systems. The suggested code was able to implement the whole pipeline
represented in
[the diagram](post14#2-pipeline-of-robotic-systems-frontend--backend), explained
in one by one. A more detailed example on how to use my frontend code can be
found
[this test suite](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/simple-robotics-pipeline/blob/main/test/pipeline_test.cc).
As a future work, I am considering a multi-thread structure with mutex
management.
