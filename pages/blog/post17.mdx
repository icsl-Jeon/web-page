<Frontmatter />

In this article, I aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the components
used in drones while drawing from my personal experiences during my time in
graduate school. As a student pursuing my studie, I had the opportunity to delve
into the fascinating world of drones and explore their various applications.
Through this article, I hope to share my knowledge and insights gained from my
research and experiences, shedding light on the essential components that make
up these remarkable aerial vehicles. Whether you are a hobbyist or a
professional in the field, understanding the intricacies of drone components is
crucial for successful operation and exploration of this exciting technology.

## 1. Control system

The control system of a drone is responsible for managing its flight and
navigation. It consists of two primary components: the onboard computer and the
flight control unit (FCU).

### Onboard computer

This computer is where your research algorithm is running. The onboard computer
handles perception and planning, enabling the drone to process sensory data and
make decisions accordingly. In many cases, the OS is linux, and many researchers
have used the following products:

- [NUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html)
  (High performance)
- [Jetson](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/)
  (GPU / cuda)
- [Upboard](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/)
  (light-weight)

The spec of the computer really depends on your scenario: how your testing
algorithm is complex, and whether your algorithm requires GPU and cuda. This
decision directly affects the payload of your drone.

### Pixhawk

  />
  <p>**Fig.** Pixhawk manual</p>
</div>

The Pixhawk is a popular FCU used in many drone systems, providing stability and
reliable flight control. The FCU is responsible for:

- interfacing the onboard computer and all the hardware components such as
  propulsion and sensors inside Pixhawk.
- Output PWM signal to control motors.
- Communication such MavLink and RC channels.
- Low-level controllers and filtering algorithm in its Firmware.
- Log and analysis using Flight review.
- Mission planning receiving.
- Flight mode changes.

For more information, refer to [Pixhawk offical site](https://pixhawk.org/) and
its
[Firmware PX4](https://docs.px4.io/main/ko/flight_controller/pixhawk_series.html).

## 2. Sensors & Communication

</div>

To operate effectively, drones rely on various sensors and communication
devices. These components enable the drone to gather information about its
surroundings and communicate with the operator or other devices. Key components
include:

### Pixhawk

As mentioned earlier, the Pixhawk serves as both a flight control unit and a
sensor hub, collecting data from different sensors and facilitating flight
control. Two representative sensors of Pixhawk are

- Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): The Pixhawk 4 usually includes an IMU that
  consists of an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. These sensors
  provide essential data for stabilizing the drone, measuring its orientation,
  and compensating for external forces.
- Barometer: A barometer sensor measures atmospheric pressure, allowing the
  Pixhawk 4 to estimate altitude and vertical speed.
- Default compass: A compass sensor, such as a magnetometer, is used to
  determine the drone's heading and orientation relative to Earth's magnetic
  field. It helps with navigation and stabilization.

It's worth noting that different Pixhawk 4 configurations or variations may
include additional or slightly different sensors. It's always recommended to
refer to the specific product documentation or manufacturer's website for the
precise details and specifications of the Pixhawk 4 you are using.

### Vision Sensor

Drones often incorporate vision sensors such as cameras or LiDAR (Light
Detection and Ranging) systems. These sensors provide vital visual data,
enabling tasks such as object detection, terrain mapping, and obstacle
avoidance. Some of frequently used sensors include:

- [Intel T265](https://www.intelrealsense.com/tracking-camera-t265/): for stable
  localization.
- [Intel D435](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435/): lightweight
  depth sensor to recognize obstacles and mapping.
- [Velodyne](https://velodynelidar.com/): when payload is sufficient, the best
  option for high-definition mapping.
- [Stereo lab ZED camera](https://www.stereolabs.com/): Reliable stereo camera.
  The driver and ROS wrapper provide extensive features for your convenience
  (VIO, obstacle detection, ground detection). One of the disadvantages is it
  requires an NVIDIA GPU.

You might need multiple sensoers, in that case, you need reliable extrinsic
calibration using libraries such as
[Kalibr](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr).

### GPS/Compass

Global Positioning System (GPS) modules provide precise positioning information,
allowing drones to navigate accurately. Compass sensors help drones maintain
their heading and orientation.

### Telemetry

Telemetry systems establish a wireless link between the drone and the ground
station, transmitting real-time flight data, status updates, and control
commands.

### RC Receiver

In cases where manual control is necessary, drones utilize a radio control (RC)
receiver to receive commands from a remote controller.

## 3. Propulsion

<div className="sm:px-5 my-10">

</div>

The propulsion system of a drone is responsible for generating the necessary
thrust to achieve and maintain flight. When selecting propulsion components,
factors such as payload capacity and flight time must be considered. Providers
like
[iFlight](https://www.google.com/search?q=iflight&oq=iflight&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l2j46i199i465i512j0i512j69i60l2j69i61.2458j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
and [T motor](https://uav-en.tmotor.com/) offer bundled products comprising ESCs
(Electronic Speed Controllers), motors, and propellers, known for their
stability and compatibility.

### ESC

Electronic Speed Controllers regulate the speed and direction of the motors,
ensuring precise control over the drone's movement. When I was in graduate
school, I used to leverage the belows:

- [DJI ESC](https://ko.aliexpress.com/item/32623834483.html)
- [Snail](https://www.dji.com/kr/snail) (not produced anymore)
- [4-in-1 ESCs](https://shop.iflight-rc.com/BLITZ-E80-4-IN1-Pro-ESC-G2-Pro1770)

### BLDC Motor

Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motors are commonly used in drones due to their
high efficiency, reliability, and compact design.

### Propeller

Propellers convert rotational motion from the motors into thrust, propelling the
drone through the air. The choice of propeller depends on factors such as
payload, flight characteristics, and motor specifications.

### Propeller Guard

Propeller guards are optional accessories that protect the propellers from
damage during flight and provide an added layer of safety.

### Lipo Battery

While not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, it's worth noting that drones
often utilize Lithium Polymer (LiPo) batteries due to their high energy density
and lightweight properties.

## 4. Body

The body or frame of a drone serves as its structural backbone, providing
stability and protection to the internal components. Factors to consider when
selecting a drone body include:

### Commercial Frame

Commercially available drone frames offer a reliable and tested solution. They
come in various sizes and configurations to accommodate different payloads and
flight requirements. Some of very famous frames include:

- [F450](https://campaign.aliexpress.com/wow/gcp/tesla-pc-new/index?UTABTest=aliabtest377151_530968&src=google&src=google&albch=shopping&acnt=631-313-3945&slnk=&plac=&mtctp=&albbt=Google_7_shopping&albagn=888888&isSmbActive=false&isSmbAutoCall=false&needSmbHouyi=false&albcp=19224801818&albag=&trgt=&crea=ko1005001270714687&netw=x&device=c&albpg=&albpd=ko1005001270714687&gclid=Cj0KCQjw756lBhDMARIsAEI0AglESbejvRM_pgsHcalOzwdGlRzxFGF4PzFQw76XPIlKQw1V2Y5W22gaAtUpEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&aff_fcid=f00a75b743244e24a203f0e9f57bd88d-1688787154152-04212-UneMJZVf&aff_fsk=UneMJZVf&aff_platform=aaf&sk=UneMJZVf&aff_trace_key=f00a75b743244e24a203f0e9f57bd88d-1688787154152-04212-UneMJZVf&terminal_id=ef435419be2f408a9b9bbe6586f9ce51&wh_weex=true&wx_navbar_hidden=true&wx_navbar_transparent=true&ignoreNavigationBar=true&wx_statusbar_hidden=true&bt_src=ppc_direct_lp&scenario=pcBridgePPC&productId=1005001270714687&OLP=1085100208_f_group2&o_s_id=1085100208)

### Landing Gear

Landing gear plays a crucial role in protecting the drone's sensitive components
during takeoff and landing. Choosing appropriate landing gear is essential to
prevent vibrations that can affect flight performance.

### Custom Connectors

In many cases, custom connectors are required to mount and connect the various
components introduced earlier. The design and production of these connectors
should be considered in the overall schedule, as it may take several weeks to
complete.
