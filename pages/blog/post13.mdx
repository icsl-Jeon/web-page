# Very Short Overview of OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library)

<Frontmatter />

This article is devoted to provide a quick overview before you dive into OMPL.

## 1. OMPL as starter of your motion planning project

### Reliability

OMPL is a very stable baseline for your motion planning development.

Since 2010, from [Lydia Kavraki](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~kavraki/)'s
Algorithmic Robotics class, OMPL has been actively developed and widely used by
[robotics researchers](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/integration.html) over a
decade. Its proven reliability led it to be used from famous open-source
projects such as [moveit](https://moveit.ros.org/).

As can be seen [here](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/gallery.html), it shows
effectiveness across diverse robot systems including robotic arms (moveit!),
[humanoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZQY_QOX0Pw&t=1s), and
[mobile robot](https://morse-simulator.github.io/).

### Flexibility by abstraction

When you saw OMPL in [many pages](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/gui.html), you
might think that OMPL has its own environmental representation such as mesh or
distance field. But it doesn't. Whatever you saw, they are all just wrappers
(such as [OMPL.app](https://github.com/ompl/omplapp))

In OMPL, user might have to define the belows to reflect their mission setup:

- [StateValidityChecker](https://github.com/ompl/ompl/blob/main/src/ompl/base/StateValidityChecker.h):
  whether a state can be reachable when obstacles or bound are considered (there
  might be more cases). A good example can be found
  [here](https://github.com/ompl/ompl/blob/e65099390abf83ea289134e275235f3cbc06b7e5/demos/OptimalPlanning.cpp#L104).
- [Propagte](https://github.com/ompl/ompl/blob/e65099390abf83ea289134e275235f3cbc06b7e5/demos/RigidBodyPlanningWithControls.cpp#L96):
  It is used when checks whether two states
  [can be connected](https://github.com/ompl/ompl/blob/main/src/ompl/base/MotionValidator.h)
  during the tree expansion phase. It is related with 1) whether it is
  control-possible (e.g., very slow car might not reach far position due to
  control limit!), or 2) whether the connecting trajectory does not hit
  obstacles.

## 2. "Sampling-based" motion planning library

### Three categories of motion planning algorithms

Except for reinforcement learning (RL), most motion planning algorithms take one
of the three approaches:

- Graph-search planners such as
  [A\* and Dijkstra algorithm](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1566/1/012061/pdf).
  They are often used when the solution domain is predefined before computing
  motions (e.g., all path points are expected on a grid).
- Sampling based planners such as
  [RRT, RRT\*, PRM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP6MRe_IHFo). This group
  randomly samples a feasible configuration (e.g., safe positions) after
  planning is triggered. In general, the planner tries to connect any two
  configurations by either simple interpolation or control dynamics.
- Optimization based planners such as
  [CHOMP](https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/chomp_planner/chomp_planner_tutorial.html)
  and [LQRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control). They use
  gradient-based numerical optimization to minimize costs such as integral of
  acceleration to generate smooth motion, observing some constraints.

Among these, OMPL only supports the second category.

### Implementations of sampling based planners

#### State space vs control space

Before beginning, we should distinguish two terms: state $s$ vs control $u$.

$$ s_{next} = f(s_{current}, u_{current}) $$

State is the **result** of previous **control**. 
For example, the pose of end-effector of a robotic arm can be seen as a state in OMPL, 
while velocities of the joints as an input.

#### Two types of planners

As can been seen from this
[documentation](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/planners.html), OMPL provides two
sub-groups:

- **Geometric planners**: try to connect two sampled configurations in state space (such as interpolations).
- **Control-based planners**: 
try to connect two sampled configurations by [control domain](https://github.com/ompl/ompl/blob/e65099390abf83ea289134e275235f3cbc06b7e5/demos/RigidBodyPlanningWithControls.cpp#LL141C39-L141C39).
This requires `propagate` user-implementation to let OMPL know they can reach next state with in control limits.
