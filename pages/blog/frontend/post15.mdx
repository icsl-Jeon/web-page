# Frontend Code for Robotic System with State Management - Part 2

<Frontmatter />

In the [previous article](/blog/frontend/post14), I wrote on the
importance of state management while defining two different types of events
which trigger state transitions.

Now, this article delves into existing patterns (library) and their
characteristics:
[Boost MSM](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/libs/msm/doc/HTML/index.html)
(c++), [Behavior tree](https://www.behaviortree.dev/) (c++), and
[Redux](https://ko.redux.js.org/) (JS).

## Boost MSM

MSM is a robust state machine library in C++ that provides a structured approach
to state management, adhering to the UML standard. It offers several advantages
for developers:

### 1. Strength

#### Structure for UML standard

Boost MSM allows developers to model state transitions and behaviors according
to the Unified Modeling Language (UML) standard. This enables clear and concise
representation of states, events, and actions.

#### Flexibility and extensibility

Boost MSM offers a high degree of flexibility, allowing developers to customize
state machines to suit their specific needs. It provides various hooks and
callbacks that enable fine-grained control over state transitions and actions.
Support for complex state machines: Boost MSM excels in handling complex state
machines with multiple states, nested states, and hierarchical structures. It
provides mechanisms for defining substate machines, composite states, and
orthogonal regions, enabling the representation of intricate system behaviors.

#### Thread safety

Boost MSM provides built-in thread safety mechanisms, making it suitable for
concurrent or multi-threaded applications. It allows developers to define
thread-safe state machines and handle synchronization and communication between
threads effectively.

#### Integration with other Boost libraries

Boost MSM seamlessly integrates with other Boost libraries, leveraging their
functionalities and enhancing the overall development experience. This
integration allows developers to combine the power of Boost MSM with other tools
and utilities available in the Boost ecosystem.

### 2. Weakness

#### Difficulty in obtaining the active state

One drawback of Boost MSM lies in its design, as there is no clean way to
retrieve the currently active state. Let us see an
[official example](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/msm/doc/HTML/examples/SimpleTutorial2.cpp)
of boost msm (I wrote some comments for explanation):

```cpp filename="boot msm example"

  // events are defined outside of state machine
  struct play {};
  struct end_pause {};
  struct stop {};
  struct pause {};
  struct open_close {};

  ...

  // front-end: define the FSM structure
  struct player_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<player_>
  {
      ...

      // The list of FSM states: these are define inside of state machine !!
      struct Empty : public msm::front::state<>
      {
        ...
      };
      struct Open : public msm::front::state<>
      {
        ...
      };

```

Then, what is the recommended way to identify the currently active state? First
of all, as per **Active state** section of
[this document](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/msm/doc/HTML/ch03s05.html):

> The backend also offers a way to know which state is active, though you will
> normally only need this for debugging purposes. If what you need simply is
> doing something with the active state, internal transitions or visitors are a
> better alternative. If you need to know what state is active, const int\*
> current_state() will return an array of state ids. Please refer to the
> internals section to know how state ids are generated.

Thus, for example, we might have to manually identify the `id` of states by
[this kind](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/msm/doc/HTML/ch06s03.html#internals-state-id)
of method.

##### This becomes problematic when we are handling [MonitorEvent](http://localhost:3000/design-pattern/frontend/post14#monitor-events-to-be-handled-by-robots-autonomously).

Assume that we want do the following:

```cpp
MyMachine msm_machine_;
while(true){
  auto e = DetectSomeEvent()
  msm_machine_.process_event(e)
  ...
}
```

When writing `DetectSomeEvent()`, we might want to detect an event based on
`current state`, because detecting an event can be computationally demanding.

```cpp filename="State based event computation"
Event DetectSomeEvent() {
  auto current_state = msm_machine_.get_state() // this line is not possible !!
  switch (current_state) {
    case StateA:
    case StateB:
      // perform event detection code

  }
}
```

#### Lack of graphical flow chart support

Boost MSM does not provide native support for creating graphical flow charts.
Developers may find it challenging to visualize the state transitions,
potentially impeding the understanding of complex state machines. Also, there is
not handy tool to create such table as below (I really want to ask how the
authors are writing this kind of table even while using formatters..):

```cpp
struct transition_table : mpl::vector<
      //    Start     Event         Next      Action/Guard
      //  +---------+-------------+---------+---------------------+----------------------+
    a_row2 < Stopped , play        , Playing , Stopped , &Stopped::start_playback         >,
    a_row2 < Stopped , open_close  , Open    , Empty   , &Empty::open_drawer              >,
      _row < Stopped , stop        , Stopped                                              >,
      //  +---------+-------------+---------+---------------------+----------------------+
    a_row2 < Open    , open_close  , Empty   , Open    , &Open::close_drawer              >,
      //  +---------+-------------+---------+---------------------+----------------------+
    ...
      //  +---------+-------------+---------+---------------------+----------------------+
        > {};
```

## BehaviorTree.CPP

Although behavior trees are not state machines, they are often employed for flow
management in robotics and game design. I want to you study the comparison
between
[state machine vs behavior tree](https://www.google.com/search?q=behavior+tree+vs+state+machine&oq=behavior+tree+vs+st&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i512j0i30j0i8i30j0i5i30j0i8i30.7025j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
As this aricle focuses on library aspect, I will skip this comparison.

Let's explore the advantages and disadvantages of using behavior trees:

### 1. Strength

#### Subtree inclusion

Behavior trees excel in modularizing complex behaviors through the concept of
sub trees. This allows for the reuse and composition of smaller, manageable
behavior modules.

#### Groot description language

Behavior trees can be described using a domain-specific language (DSL) called
[Groot](https://www.behaviortree.dev/groot/). This language simplifies the
creation and modification of behavior tree structures, enhancing readability and
maintainability.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center">
  <Image
    src="/images/post15/nav2-bt.png"
    width={1000}
    height={500}
    className="my-3"
  />
  <p>**Fig.** Behavior tree used in nav2</p>
</div>

### 2. Weakness

#### Readability issues with growing trees

As behavior trees grow larger and more complex, their readability can diminish.
It can become cumbersome to comprehend the entire tree structure, making it
harder to identify and troubleshoot issues. In contrast, a few lines of code may
be more readable than following numerous blocks and arrows.

#### Learning curve and terminology

Understanding behavior tree concepts and associated terminology may require some
initial effort. Developers unfamiliar with behavior trees may need time to grasp
the various nodes, their behaviors, and how they interact.

## Redux

When it comes to state management in front-end development, Redux stands out as
a popular choice. It offers a flexible and efficient approach to managing
application state, providing developers with a range of advantages.

### Simplicity of Reducers (strength of boost msm)

One of the notable strengths of Redux is the simplicity of its reducers
(function that computes a new state from previous state and action). Reducers
are pure functions responsible for handling state transitions based on
dispatched actions. Typically consisting of switch statements or if-else
conditions, reducers offer a straightforward and intuitive way to define state
transitions. Let's consider an example (I will use the code structure in
[this repo](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/proshop_django/tree/master/frontend)):

```js filename="src/reducers/cartReducers.js"
export const cartReducer = (state = { cartItems: [], shippingAddress: {} }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case CART_ADD_ITEM:
      const item = action.payload
      const existItem = state.cartItems.find(x => x.product === item.product)

      if (existItem) {
        return {
          ...state,
          cartItems: state.cartItems.map(x =>
              x.product === existItem.product ? item : x)
        }

      } else {
        return {
          ...state,
          cartItems: [...state.cartItems, item]
        }
      }

    case CART_REMOVE_ITEM:
      return {
        ...state,
        cartItems: state.cartItems.filter(x => x.product !== action.payload)
      }

```

This reducer is dispatched from
[its wrapper](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/proshop_django/blob/master/frontend/src/actions/cartActions.js)
as below:

```js
export const addToCart = (id, qty) => async (dispatch, getState) => {
  const { data } = await axios.get(`/api/products/${id}`);

  dispatch({
    type: CART_ADD_ITEM,
    payload: {
      product: data._id,
      name: data.name,
      image: data.image,
      price: data.price,
      countInStock: data.countInStock,
      qty,
    },
  });
  localStorage.setItem("cartItems", JSON.stringify(getState().cart.cartItems));
};
```

### Modularization through Multiple Reducers (strength of behavior tree)

Redux allows developers to modularize their state management through the use of
multiple reducers. **Each reducer can handle a specific portion of the global
state**, promoting code organization and maintainability. This approach is akin
to the subtree insertion capability offered by behavior trees. Let's consider
[an example](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/proshop_django/blob/master/frontend/src/store.js):

```js filename="store.js"
const reducer = combineReducers({
  productList: productListReducer,
  productDetails: productDetailsReducer,
  productDelete: productDeleteReducer,
  productCreate: productCreateReducer,
  productUpdate: productUpdateReducer,
  productReviewCreate: productReviewCreateReducer,
  productTopRated: productTopRatedReducer,

  cart: cartReducer,
  userLogin: userLoginReducer,
  userRegister: userRegisterReducer,
  userDetails: userDetailsReducer,
  userUpdateProfile: userUpdateProfileReducer,
  userList: userListReducer,
  userDelete: userDeleteReducer,
  userUpdate: userUpdateReducer,

  orderCreate: orderCreateReducer,
  orderDetails: orderDetailsReducer,
  orderPay: orderPayReducer,
  orderListMy: orderListMyReducer,
  orderList: orderListReducer,
  orderDeliver: orderDeliverReducer,
});
```

### Global State Accessibility (overcome weakness of msm)

Another strength of Redux lies in its global state accessibility. The state is
defined globally within the store, making it easily accessible throughout the
application.

```js
// Timer callback
function timerCallback() {
  const currentState = store.getState().cart.status;
  if (currentState === "ready") {
    // Perform action relevant to the "ready" state
    // ...
  }
}

// Set up timer
setInterval(timerCallback, 1000);
```

## Summary

The simplicity of reducers, modularization through multiple reducers, and global
state accessibility empower developers to build scalable and maintainable
applications, by overcoming the weakness of Boost msm and Behavior tree. By
leveraging Redux's strengths, developers can streamline their state management
process, enhance code readability, and efficiently handle events based on the
current state. With Redux at their disposal, front-end developers can unlock the
full potential of their applications while maintaining a robust and maintainable
codebase.

However, it is important to note that Redux, as it stands, is not directly
applicable to C++ due to the fundamental language differences between the two.
Redux relies heavily on JavaScript's functional programming paradigm and its
dynamic nature, which may not translate seamlessly to the statically-typed and
object-oriented nature of C++.

Adapting Redux concepts to C++ requires careful consideration of the language's
features and design patterns, ensuring a suitable approach is chosen for the
specific needs of C++ development. This may involve building custom state
management libraries or leveraging existing C++ libraries that provide similar
functionality.
