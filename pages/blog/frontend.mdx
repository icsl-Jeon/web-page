</div>

Throughout three articles, we discuss how to implement a frontend code to manage
the robotic pipeline represented in the above diagram. The code includes:

- Update monitors and event definitions.
- Event handlers and state transition.
- [Strategy pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy/cpp/example)
  of motion policy for control computation.
- Memory to revert to previous policy.

The full code implementation can be found
[here](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/simple-robotics-pipeline).
