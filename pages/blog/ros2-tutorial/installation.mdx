# Getting Started ROS2

We will proceed with
[Humble ROS release](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Releases.html) as it is the
most stable and recent LTS. This page explains the installation.

In summary:

- Option 1: For the best learning and development experience, it is highly
  recommended to install Ubuntu 22.04. Ubuntu 20.04 is also okay. But you might
  have difficulties during the last part of this tutorial.
- Option 2: If you need to learn ROS on Windows, opt for WSL (Windows Subsystem
  for Linux) and install Ubuntu version instead of the
  [Windows native version](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Windows-Install-Binary.html).
- Option 3: For those who don't have either of the above options, I have created
  a Docker image.

## Installation options

### Option 1: Ubuntu 22.04 (best case)

If you can use Ubuntu 22.04, it caters
[Humble ROS release](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Releases.html) in its source
list. You can install ROS locally. All you need is just to follow
[the instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)
by copy-and-paste. Install full desktop packages by
`sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop`. It can take a couple of minutes.

#### For Ubuntu 20.04 users

You cannot install locally Humble version in this case. Instead, you have to use
the earlier version Foxy. Although as of now July 2023, choosing Humble your
target distribution is the best option, Foxy is enough for learning the basics
of ROS2. Visit
[here](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)
and follow the instructions one by one.

### Option 2: WSL2 (Windows users)

To learn ROS2 on a Windows machine, setting up a Linux environment can
significantly enhance the learning experience, rather than following Windows
native installation of ROS. One efficient way to achieve this is by utilizing
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2).

#### Bring Ubuntu to Windows

Firstly, you need to install
[WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on your Windows
system to have a virtual environment for Ubuntu 22.04.

Follow the steps in
[this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXPBpmeURS4&t=1s) to get
WSL2 up and running. After opening ubuntu terminal, please make sure
`lsb_release -a` outputs 22.04 version.

```
user_name@user:~$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
Release:        22.04
Codename:       jammy
```

If your default Ubuntu distribution is not 22.04 (e.g., 20.04), visit the
Microsoft Store and install Ubuntu
[22.04](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/ubuntu-22042-lts/9PN20MSR04DW?hl=ko-kr&gl=kr&rtc=1)
instead.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  You should `sudo apt-get update` before installing ROS2. Ubuntu installation
  on WSL has little installations of essential libraries compared to native
  Ubuntu installation.
</Callout>

#### Enable GUIs (Only for Windows 10 Users)

If you are a Windows 11 user, you can access the GUIs running on Ubuntu
terminal, out-of-box. Run `xmessage --center hello` and a small window will
popup. However, if you are running Ubuntu on WSL 2 of Windows 10, you have to do
additional setup. Follow
[the tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL8nnuvybL8) for this
process:

#### Same Process with Ubuntu on WSL

Now you can use Ubuntu on Windows. Overall, the remainder is the same as what
[this page](ubuntu) explains.

### Option 3. Docker

1. First of all, if you have not installed docker, follow the installation guide
   [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). Windows users can
   install Docker by following
   [this link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).
2. Pull the prepared
   [image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bfjeon/ros2-humble/general)
   by
   ```
   docker pull bfjeon/ros2-humble
   ```
   This image is Ubuntu 22.04 and contained basic features like
   `bash-completion` to resemble a clean Ubuntu installation as best as
   possible.

## Starting a Simple ROS program

We run a demo program in the package
[turtlesim](https://www.google.com/search?q=turtlesi&oq=turtlesi&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59l3j0i20i263i512j69i60l3.1627j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
During part1, this package will help us to understand the basics of ROS2.

### To be checked

#### Installation directory `/opt/ros/humble`

The installations of core and shipped packages are installed in
`/opt/ros/humble` (if you installed foxy, `/opt/ros/foxy`). later if you want to
remove ROS2, delete the directory.

#### Sourcing `setup.bash`

To utilize the convenient commands provided by ROS in terminals, we need to
configure the opened terminal to recognize the set of ROS commands by sourcing
the file `/opt/ros/humble/setup.bash` into your terminal. Open `~/.bashrc` and
make sure the line `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash` is written.

```bash filename="~/.bashrc" {9}
if ! shopt -oq posix; then
  if [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
    . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
  elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
  fi
fi

source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

After completing these steps, you will be able to utilize tab-completion. When
you type ros2 and press the tab button on a terminal, the following options will
appear:

```
rosmarry@rosmarry:~$ ros2 // press tab will show the belows:
--use-python-default-buffering  doctor                          lifecycle                       run
action                          extension_points                multicast                       security
bag                             extensions                      node                            service
component                       interface                       param                           topic
daemon                          launch                          pkg                             wtf
```

#### Install demo package if not installed

Run `sudo apt-get install ros-humble-turtlesim` in case it's not installed.

### Run demo program `turtlesim_node`

Open a terminal (calling Terming A) and run the command:

```none filename="Terminal A"
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

This will open a GUI window. In the center, you will find a turtle.

In another terminal (Terminal B)

```none filename="Terminal B"
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
```

And in Terminal B, try pressing arrow-keys to move the turtle.

## What's next?

Congratulation üëç You're all set. From the next page, we will have a fun while
learning the fundamentals of ROS with the adorable turtle and your terminal.
