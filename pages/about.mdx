# Hello, I am Boseong Jeon ðŸ˜ƒ

Thank you for visiting my website! I am a robotics engineer who loves building a
robotic system and exploring the latest advancements in the field of robotics.\
As a dedicated researcher and a developer with PhD, I have covered a wide range of
areas from designing hardwares, object recognition, online spatial mapping, and motion
planning & controls.\
Through this website, I hope to share my expertise and insights with fellow
robotics enthusiasts, students, and professionals. Here, you will find
informative articles, tutorials, and reviews on the latest robotic technologies,
as well as my thoughts on the future of robotics and its impact on society.

## What Can I Bring ?

### Real-time motion planning (major)

  <YouTube videoId="ZBFRS5TpRvI" className="videoWrapper" />
</div>

I majored in 3D real-time motion planning methods based on the 3D vision data,
which can avoid obstacles (including dynamic ones) and chase a moving target.
Although my main platform were drones, I can deal with mobile robots and robotic
arms also.

- Practical experiences in optimization-based planning methods such as LQR,
  STOMP, and [CHOMP](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/chomp_predict)
- Hierarchical planning [methods](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/traj_gen) which
  can joint global path planners and local planners.

### Online 3D spatial mapping and object tracking

  <YouTube videoId="Ux1_LinLegM" className="videoWrapper" />
</div>

I can efficiently process the incoming sensor data into robot-recognizable forms
for various tasks (obstacle mapping, target tracking and prediction).

- Online [distance map](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/octomap_mapping) building
  from octomap or voxblox
- Object recognition, [tracking pose](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/zed2_client),
  and [motion prediction](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/chasing_utils).
- Hands-on-experiences of VIO and Lidar odometry algorithms such as LeGO-LOAM.

### System integration and leading field experiments

As a robotics engineer, I am used to scheduling, and performing experiments in
any sites whether indoor, or outdoor.
