# RAPTOR: Robust and Perception-aware Trajectory Replanning for Quadrotor Fast Flight

<Frontmatter />;

This article will briefly study the
[RAPTOR motion planner](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8758904) written by
_Boyu Zhou_ when he was in HKUST (now, he is a professor in other university!)
Overall, this paper is well-suited for those who are interested in local motion
planning in unknown environments.

## Keys to fast-flying in completely unknown environments

I will skip the very naive qualities such as computation speed of a motion
planning algorithm to avoid abrupt obstacles. Instead, we will focus on the
three:

- Having a set of back-up motions (topologically distinct)
- Risk-aware behavior to avoid collision in the unknown area
- Leveraging yaw motion of active exploration to gather information

This paper stacks the above considerations on top of his
[original work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8758904/) released
in 2019. Thus, this paper (RAPTOR) requires basic backgrounds on the properties
of B-Spline and its optimization on control points. Before reading, it is
recommended to be familiar with the belows:

### Preliminary

- [PRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_roadmap)
- [Path topology and deformation (PDR)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364908098411?journalCode=ijra)
- [B-splines and convex hull](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8758904/)
- [Gradient-based optimization (CHOMP)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5152817)

## Pipeline of the local planner

### 1. Optimistic generation of topologically distinct motion list (x,y,z)

### 2. Risk-aware refinement for the motions (or for only the best)

### 3. Active yaw planning for information-gathering.
