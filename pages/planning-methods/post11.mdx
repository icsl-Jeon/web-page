# RAPTOR: Robust and Perception-aware Trajectory Replanning for Quadrotor Fast Flight

<Frontmatter />

This article will briefly study the
[RAPTOR motion planner](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8758904) written by
_Boyu Zhou_, et al, when he was in HKUST (now, he is a professor in other
university!) Overall, this paper is well-suited for those who are interested in
local motion planning in unknown environments.

## Keys to fast-flying in completely unknown environments

I will skip the very naive qualities such as computation speed of a motion
planning algorithm to avoid abrupt obstacles. Instead, we will focus on the
three:

- Having a set of back-up motions (topologically distinct)
- Risk-aware behavior to avoid collision in the unknown area
- Leveraging yaw motion of active exploration to gather information

This paper stacks the above considerations on top of his
[original work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8758904/) released
in 2019. Thus, this paper (RAPTOR) requires basic backgrounds on the properties
of B-Spline and its optimization on control points. Before reading, it is
recommended to be familiar with the belows:

- [PRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_roadmap)
- [Path topology and deformation (PDR)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364908098411?journalCode=ijra)
- [B-splines and convex hull](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8758904/)
- [ESDF](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8968199)
- [Gradient-based optimization (CHOMP)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5152817)

## Pipeline of the local planner

This figure is brought from the original paper and I annotated four magenta blocks
for explanation.{" "}

### Step 1. Optimistic generation of topologically distinct skeleton paths

The term _optimistic_ is used in this paper to refer the motion (or path) which
does not consider the risk of a collision with obstacles in the unknown region.
The purpose of this step is to generate a set of path skeletons from RPM-like
method, so that they have a short length, while representing a set of
topologically similar paths.

The left figure shows the refinement process which reduces the length of paths
(naive RPM result) in a distinct topologies. The right figure is the result of
refinement. Each color represent a distinct topology.

### Step 2. Optimization for B spline based on skeletons (PGO)

The authors uses the multiple skeletons as a guidance to generate multiple
B-Spline trajectories.  
In the paper, PGO (path guided optimization) refers to the optimization process
where each B-Spline is generated by optimally following the skeleton path, while
avoiding obstacle, with further smoothing. This process is performed for each
skeleton, and the most smoothed one is picked for local planning. (but still
this is not the final one..)

The PGO takes two steps: first (left figure), we optimize control points of the
B-Spline to track the skeleton (w/o obstacle consideration). Second (right
figure), we consider ESDF to push the output of first phase away form obstacles
more.

### Step 3. Risk-aware refinement for the motions (visibility-enhancement)

Personally, I found this process very interesting: detouring for better
visibility not to crash with the obstacles hiding in the unknown areas.

### Step 4. Active yaw planning for information-gathering.
