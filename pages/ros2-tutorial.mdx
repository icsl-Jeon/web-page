# ROS2 Tutorial by Felipe Jeon

## Why is this different from the official document?

Three C reasons:

1. Concise: This tutorial will provide you with essential design patterns and
   concepts at the beginner level, ensuring you learn precisely what you need
   without overwhelming you with unnecessary information.
2. Coherent: Unlike the official tutorial, this guide presents information in a
   clear and organized manner. Concepts and demos are logically structured,
   avoiding confusion and making it easier for readers to follow along.
3. Comprehensive: The official document contains too simple programs. This
   tutorial serves as a full boot camp, starting from the basics and guiding you
   through the use of the latest tools and other new packages. By completing
   this tutorial, you will gain the confidence to navigate through the official
   documents with ease.

## Who should follow this tutorial?

1. ROS Newbie: If you are completely new to ROS and have no background in ROS 1,
   this guide is designed to help you rapidly build a ROS 2 program from
   scratch.
2. ROS 2 Tutorial Reader: If you have already gone through the official
   [ROS 2 tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) but still have
   only a vague idea of how to create your own ROS program.
3. ROS 1 to ROS 2 Migrator: For those who already possess experience in ROS 1
   and are considering transitioning to ROS 2, this guide offers valuable
   insights and guidance to facilitate a smooth migration process.

## What will you learn?

### Part 1: Getting Familiar with ROS2

In this introductory section, we lay the foundation of your ROS2 knowledge.
You'll learn about the essential CLI commands, and the core concepts of ROS2 and
communication types like topic communication and service communication. In this
part, we are working with prebuilt nodes on terminal without writing codes.

### Part 2: Writing Practical ROS2 Programs with Code Patterns

Now that you have a solid understanding of ROS2, it's time to get hands-on works
with coding. You will learn code patterns to fast build a practical ROS code.
Also, you will learn how to effectively manage large projects with launch files.
Last, this section guides you to apply essential tools including physics
simulation and visualization.

### Part 3: Mastering Advanced Tools and Packages

Part 3 introduces you to advanced tools and packages that will empower you to
create sophisticated robotic systems. Explore concepts like Executors and
Lifecycle management, and get hands-on experience with powerful packages like
Moveit and Nav2. Hardware integration and rosbag recording for data logging will
be crucial skills you'll acquire in this section.
