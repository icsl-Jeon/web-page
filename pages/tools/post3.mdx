# If You Use Vscode, Use CMake Extension Instead of `c_cpp_properties.json`

<Frontmatter />

For Ubuntu users working with CMake projects and writing C++ code, it's
important to set up Visual Studio Code (VSCode) correctly for smooth
auto-completion and debugging.

Many of vscode users would use `c_cpp_properties.json` to
[make vscode find headers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/c-cpp-properties-schema-reference)
during code completion (for the interested, checkout this
[tutorial](https://youtu.be/XF_cSibAwAU)). But actually, this is not a good
idea.

## Pitfall of using c_cpp_properties.json

If we rely on `c_cpp_properties.json`, we are **manually feeding** header search
paths to vscode. Although this works for code-completion, your project might not
be built correctly. The reason is simple. Success of building process has
nothing to do with vscode, and its supporter, `c_cpp_properties.json`, as
compilers will use CMakeLists.txt for building, not the json file. (Consider you
did not give anything how to compile your project in `c_cpp_properties.json`.)

Due to this, users might come across a **mismatch** between vscode and
compilers. For example, although your vscode found no problems in your code,
your CMake project cannot be built while not finding some headers.

## CMakeLists.txt has everything we need to know

This is an example `CMakeLists.txt` (I brought this from my
[repo](https://github.com/icsl-Jeon/simple-cmake-package/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt))

```cmake
project(my_awesome_project)

include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
...
find_package(SimplePackage REQUIRED)
add_executable(client_project_executable main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(client_project_executable simple_package)
```

As you can see, this file actually has every information a compiler needs to
know.

- `include_directories`: which folders to include to search headers.
- `find_package`: which package to read and where to find the libraries and
  headers of the packages.
- `target_link_libraries`: which libraries to be linked.

So, if vscode can **well-extract** the information, it is nonsense that we
cannot do code-completion for our CMake project!

## Setup CMake extension for configure, build, and debug

### Prerequisites

You should install gcc, g++, gdb, and cmake. If not installed, do:

```sh
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ gdb cmake
```

### How to use CMake extension

Fully leveraging `CMakeLists.txt` on vscode can be done by
[CMake extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-linux). I
uploaded on youtube how to setup the extension for configure, build, and debug
